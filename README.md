# Global AI Hackathon, Amsterdam
## Team: The sourcerers

## Why?
People nowadays get overwhelmed by the news. More often those results are fake, but nobody can protect users against it. We detect the origin of the source and how the news spreads. This way we can determine how it is fake!

## What?
With our solution, the users will receive advice about their news content. Based on our machine learning algorithms we can predict if the news is fake, but it will only give an advice about three criteria: source, website and author. The three criteria will be labeled as bad, normal or good. An explanation for this label is given if clicked on it.

## How?
