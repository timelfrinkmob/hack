"DNA discovery reveals genetic history","Correcting past errors Depending on which way you see it, ancient Egyptians have the privilege or ignominy of being one of the most investigated peoples of antiquity. Scientists have virtually undressed mummies, diagnosed from beyond the grave, and exposed miscarriages and 3,000-year-old scams. Extracting genome data is a new frontier for Egyptologists, however. Scientists took 166 bone samples from 151 mummies, dating from approximately 1400 B.C. to A.D. 400, extracting DNA from 90 individuals and mapping the full genome in three cases. A scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History looks at a jaw bone. Bone, soft tissue and teeth were all studied as part of the research. Previous DNA analysis of mummies has been treated with a necessary dose of skepticism, explains professor Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute. Oldest Homo sapiens fossils discovered "When you touch a bone, you probably leave more DNA on the bone than is inside (it)," he argued. "Contamination is a big issue. ... Only in the last five or six years has it become possible to actually study DNA from ancient humans, because we can now show whether DNA is ancient or not by (its) chemical properties." Heat and high humidity in tombs, paired with some of the chemicals involved in mummification, all contribute to DNA degradation, the paper adds, but it describes its findings as "the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians." Analyzing samples spanning over a millennium, researchers looked for genetic differences compared with Egyptians today. They found that the sample set showed a strong connection with a cluster of ancient non-African populations based east of the Mediterranean Sea. Krause describes the far-reaching data set gained from looking at mitochondrial genomes: "This is not just the DNA of one person. It's the DNA of the parents, grandparents, grandparents' parents, grand-grand-grandparents' parents and so forth. Exploring Sudan's forgotten pyramids "So if we don't find sub-Saharan African ancestry in those people, that is pretty representative, at least for Middle Egypt." Krause hypothesizes that ancient Northern Egypt would be much the same, if not more, linked to the Near East. Ancient Southern Egypt might be a different matter, however, where populations lived closer to Nubia, home of the "Black Pharaohs" in what is now Sudan. Historical conquests One of the mummies analyzed as part of the study. The human remains were discovered in the 1920s by a historian studying papyrus writings, says Krause. "The genetics of the Abusir el-Meleq community did not undergo any major shifts during the 1,300-year timespan we studied," said Wolfgang Haak, group leader at the Max Planck Institute. This period covered the rule of Alexander the Great (332-323 B.C.), the Ptolemaic dynasty (323-30 B.C.) and part of Roman rule (30 B.C.-A.D. 641). Strict social structures and legal incentives to marry along ethnic lines within these communities may have played a part in the Egyptians' genetic stasis, the paper speculates. Egypt unearths 8 mummies in 3,500-year-old tombs "A lot of people has assumed foreign invaders ... brought a lot of genetic ancestry into the region," Krause said. "People expected that through time, Egypt would become more European, but we see the exact opposite." Modern Egyptians were found to "inherit 8% more ancestry from African ancestors" than the mummies studied. The paper cites increased mobility along the Nile, increased long-distance commerce and the era of the trans-Saharan slave trade as potential reasons why. The team's findings do come with one obvious caveat: "All our genetic data (was) obtained from a single site in Middle Egypt and may not be representative for all of ancient Egypt," the paper concedes. 'Lost' early photographs shed light on Sudan's Nuba and Latuka tribes While the study might be limited in scope, the team believes it has made some technical breakthroughs. "I expect there will be a ton of ancient Egyptian mummy genomes (mapped) in the next couple of years," Krause said, adding that "multiple groups" are following his team's lead. "There's always more research we can do. This is not the end. It's just the beginning."",http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/22/health/ancient-egypt-mummy-dna-genome-heritage/index.html,2017-06-22 23:06:21
"Thunderbird F-16 Military Jet Flips Over at Dayton, Ohio, Air Show Practice","A fighter jet from the famed U.S. Air Force group the Thunderbirds ran off the runway after landing and flipped over at a Dayton airfield as the team practiced for an air show, officials said. The pilot suffered injuries that are not life-threatening. The U.S. Air Force said the F-16 Fighting Falcon was involved in a "mishap" upon landing at about 12:20 p.m. ET. Dayton officials said two people were on board the plane. Lt. Col. Jason Heard, commander of the Thunderbirds, said at a news conference that the pilot, Capt. Erik Gonsalves, suffered lacerations to his head as well as a leg injury. Sgt. Kenneth Cordova did not have visible injuries, Heard said. A plane is on its top at the Dayton International Airport after practicing for the Vectren Dayton Air Show on June 23, 2017 in Dayton, Ohio. WDTN Both were conscious and talking when they were extracted from the 25,000-pound plane and taken to the hospital. Gonsalves and Cordova had approximately 1,600 hours of flight experience. A safety board will investigate and determine the cause of the mishap. The Wright Patterson Air Force Base said its firefighters responded alongside the airport's fire and rescue team. The crew of the F-16 had planned to do a routine flyover ahead of this weekend's 2017 Vectren Dayton Air Show to familiarize themselves with the area, Heard said. The jet that crashed upon landing was not scheduled to perform at the show. The Thunderbirds were practicing their aerobatic maneuvers in thunderstorm conditions. Wind gusts this afternoon were about 11 to 17 miles per hour, Weather.com reported. According to Heard, the Thunderbirds will not to fly in Saturday's show. It wasn't immediately known if they will fly Sunday. The Dayton Air Show is no stranger to tragedy: In 2013, a pilot and stunt walker were killed when their bi-plane crashed onto the runway and burst into flames as spectators looked on.",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/thunderbird-f-16-military-jet-flips-over-dayton-ohio-air-n776081,1484-2-5 3:14:26
"Ray Tensing Trial: Mistrial Declared for a Second Time","An Ohio judge declared a mistrial for the second time in the case against Ray Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer charged with the 2015 shooting of an unarmed black driver during a traffic stop. After five days of deliberations, the jury said Friday afternoon it was deadlocked and Hamilton County Judge Leslie Ghiz declared a mistrial in the murder and voluntary manslaughter trial. The case spurred from a deadly encounter, caught on police cameras, between Tensing and 43-year-old motorist Samuel DuBose.

The first round also ended in a mistrial last year with a jury unable to come to a unanimous verdict after deliberating for more than 20 hours. DuBose's family said in a statement released shortly after the mistrial that they were "outraged" that a second jury failed to convict Tensing "for the murder of our beloved Sam DuBose." "We demand another retrial. We call on the community to join us in peaceful protest of this unjust result," the family said. Samuel Dubose is seen in a family photo distributed by attorney Mark O'Mara Courtesy of Dubose family DuBose, a 43-year-old father of 13, was driving near the University of Cincinnati in July 2015 when he was pulled over by Tensing for missing a front license plate, police said. Tensing asked DuBose for his driver's license and registration, which he failed to provide. The officer then ordered him to step out of his car and tried to open the door, but DuBose refused. The car began to pull away. With one hand still inside the car, Tensing yelled, "Stop! Stop!" before firing his gun at DuBose, striking him in the head. The car then began traveling out of control before coming to a stop. Tensing's bodycam captured the incident. The men had a conversation for about one minute and 50 seconds before it escalated with Tensing and DuBose in a struggle. Within just a few seconds, Tensing fired his gun.

Prosecutors quickly announced murder and voluntary manslaughter charges against Tensing, and he became the first officer in Cincinnati to face murder charges for killing someone while on duty. Tensing told investigators that he feared for his life. Jurors in the second trial consisted of nine white jurors and three black jurors. During closing arguments, prosecutors said the case was a "slam-dunk" on manslaughter charges, according to NBC Cincinnati WLWT5. Meanwhile, defense attorneys said Tensing feared for his life and that questing on the officer’s actions is "20/20 hindsight."

"North Korea Defectors Find Unlikely Haven in London Suburb","LONDON — The defectors who now call "Little Pyongyang" home paid a heavy price to get there. "My big brother is currently in prison in North Korea and he's not getting released any time soon," Kim Kwang Myong told NBC News. "The reason he is in prison is because of us fleeing the country." “It was a life-or-death decision” Around 5,300 miles from North Korea's brutal dictatorship, the bland commuter suburb of New Malden has become an improbable home to hundreds of escapees. With its sleepy town center and large, semi-detached houses, it is a world away from the human-rights abuses, poverty and isolation of their homeland. Kim's story is a common one. Like many people here, he fled North Korea but left family members behind. The regime often exercises a merciless policy of collective punishment against remaining relatives, sending them to labor camps, or worse. Kim, a 46-year-old carpenter, knew this. But he said inhumane conditions in the country gave him no choice. "When I left North Korea it was a life-or-death decision," he said, speaking while colleagues around him noisily renovated a new Korean butchery in New Malden. Kim Kwang Myong Carolina Reid / NBC News Picking his moment, Kim bribed some border guards to vacate a stretch of North Korea's river border with China, allowing him to cross with his wife and two children. That was 20 years ago. He has since lived illegally in China and then in South Korea before coming to the U.K. four years ago. Kim has tried to help his relatives who stayed behind by sending them money. It was this that led to them being punished after authorities discovered the transactions. "My younger brother was sent to prison and stayed there for one year but got released. But my big brother has not been so lucky," he said. His family has suffered, and that knowledge weighs heavily on Kim. "We are talking about two different worlds, really," he said of the difference between his new and old homes. "The reason why we fled from there is because life over there is really hard. It is simply impossible to live." Nazi-style camps Totalitarian North Korea restricts every aspect of public life, throwing people into Nazi-style camps for crimes as petty as "gossiping" about the state. Ordinary citizens are not allowed to access the internet or the international press, instead having to rely on the propaganda of North Korea's state-run media.

Trump has refused to rule out military action — an option experts warn would likely result in deadly retaliation against American allies and a war that could kill up to 1 million people. Nonetheless, Kim Jong Un's regime continues to promise to build a nuclear weapon capable of hitting to the U.S. mainland. So North Koreans wanting to flee is understandable. But their choice of a new life in a nondescript suburb on the other side of the planet needs more explaining. New Malden sits on the edge of the British capital and the rural county of Surrey. It's the type of place that, despite its ZIP code, most city-dwellers might dismiss as not-really-London. “We were at a crossroads whether to be sent to prison or fleeing from the country” It boasts a huge Korean population, officially around 3,500 but with some estimates putting it closer to 20,000 in the wider borough. Most of these are South Koreans who flocked here, so the theory goes, because it used to be the site of Britain's old Samsung headquarters and the residence of the South Korean ambassador. Of this community, several hundred are North Korean — making it the largest such community in Europe and one of the biggest outside the Korean Peninsula. North Korea sees the United States, South Korea and Japan as its arch enemies, so many defectors feel they cannot resettle there. This is either because of lingering misgivings about countries they've been taught to hate, or because they fear their left-behind family members will be treated more harshly if they go there. The New Malden area of London. Carolina Reid / NBC News There were 655 North Koreans registered as living in the U.K. as of 2015, according to United Nations figures. However, the European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea believes the actual is likely closer to 1,000. Most have settled in New Malden. Its residential side-streets are quaint and leafy, giving a hint of the English countryside that's just five miles down the A3 highway. But look closer and hints of Korea begin to make themselves apparent. Characters of Hangul script are daubed on an upstairs window above a shoe-repair shop. There is a Korean travel agent and a handful of Korean stores and restaurants. One of these, a Korean barbecue, is owned by a 34-year-old restaurateur who only wants to be identified by his nickname, King, amid fears of his family being punished. His story is also one of heart-wrenching do-or-die decisions and a family ripped in two. King, 34, is among the North Koreans living in New Malden. Carolina Reid / NBC News King fled his homeland with his mother and sister when he was aged 18. But his father, a high school teacher who felt loyalty to his job and fear of the regime, stayed behind. "He didn't agree with us leaving," King told NBC News while grilling meat over a high flame in his restaurant's kitchen. "He knew what would happen to him but he also knew there was nothing for me in North Korea." As punishment for his family's actions, his father was fired and sent to a labor camp. Nowadays, King only gets to speak to his dad once every two or three years, on the rare occasion his father can get an illicit cellphone capable of making international calls. He hasn't spoken to any of his friends since he left. "Yes, I miss them, of course, but I have friends here now," King said. He quietly added: "It's difficult to talk about my life here and my life in North Korea."

Before they fled, his aunt had already escaped to China and they risked being punished by proxy if they stayed put. "We were at a crossroads whether to be sent to prison or fleeing from the country," he said. 'The difference is like hell and heaven' Although the town has a distinct Korean tinge, the cultural hub is at an industrial park around 15-minute walk from its center. Here, the Korea Foods superstore acts like a wormhole, whisking shoppers away from the humdrum suburbs and into the heart of downtown Seoul. A cashier at the Korea Foods superstore. Carolina Reid / NBC News Even compared with metropolitan London, the vibrant array of colorful packaging, mysterious vegetables, and staff who speak little-to-no English are an arresting cultural vignette. In the rooms above the superstore are the unglamorous offices of Free NK, a North Korean newspaper run by Kim Joo Il, another defector. "If you actually compare two lives, one in North Korea and the other one in New Malden, the difference is like hell and heaven," the 43-year-old told NBC News. When he lived in North Korea, he served as an officer in the Korean People's Army and it was his job to catch defectors. He knew the risks of trying to flee. "They were all dealt with by military law, which meant public execution," Kim Joo Il said. According to him, the country's feared secret police has a network of spies so extensive that one out of every three citizens is an informant. "Your lives are under surveillance every single moment," he said. "Kim Jong Un has told his people that the tiniest thing, even the drop of a needle to the floor, should be reported back to him." An array of colorful packaging at the Korea Foods superstore in New Malden. Carolina Reid / NBC News Despite being aware of the potential consequences, he decided to take his chances and make a break for it across the Chinese border. He had already been to China in 1999 on official business. So using that trip as a reconnaissance mission, he returned in 2005 and in the dead of night swam across the River Tumen, which separates the two countries. "This is not a choice that you make in a day," he said. "This is based on a long-term emotional process. You make up your mind to escape from North Korea, and then you give up on the idea, and then you make up your mind again, and then you give up again. You go through this process so many times you cannot imagine how many times." During this time he said that his "emotional ups and downs were indescribable." Kim Joo Il was single when he fled, but he had to consider the consequences his escape would have on his remaining family members. "It's not just the family that you have in mind, you've got to actually be prepared to die, really, while escaping," he said. "Personally it took me eight years to finally make up my mind and in the eighth year I made my escape." From China, he walked, hitched rides, and scraped together enough money for the occasional train or bus fare. He traveled through Vietnam, Cambodia and finally Thailand, where he got a plane ticket to the U.K. He publishes the Free NK newspaper both in print and online, employing around five members of staff — both North and South Koreans — and highlighting the atrocities the regime is inflicting on his countrymen. Kim Joo Il, who runs the Free NK newspaper, recounts his escape from North Korea. Carolina Reid / NBC News Not only does he circulate the newspaper locally, he sends the digital files to South Korea where they are printed out, attached to balloons and dropped over North Korea as anti-regime propaganda. "We've got to have the right direction of the wind," Kim Joo Il said, proudly showing off an example of one of these airborne packages, sealed in a clear plastic bag. "The wind is really crucial to sending the newspapers to North Korea." Now well-known as a figurehead in the New Malden community, Kim Joo Il is determined to be a thorn in the side of the dictatorship. Just 10 miles to the north, in the London suburb of Ealing, is the North Korean Embassy to the U.K. Given the regime's apparent willingness to assassinate dissidents abroad — Kim Jong Un's own half-brother, for example — does he worry about his own safety? "That goes without saying," Kim Joo Il said. "Threats to our own safety are always lurking in the background."

"Donald Trump may face new legal action over Trump University","Donald Trump could face new legal action over his controversial Trump University venture, after a new suit was filed in federal court. In November, days after he won the presidency, Trump settled three class action fraud lawsuits over Trump University, for $25m. More than 6,000 people were listed in the suits, claiming they were lured into paying up to $35,000 to learn the secrets of Trump’s business success. Now, one member of the class action lawsuits, Sherri Simpson, has filed an appeal against the settlement, claiming she was not allowed to exercise her right to “opt out” of the multimillion-dollar deal. Being Donald Trump: the life of an impersonator Read more If the ninth circuit court of appeals – one of two courts that ruled against Trump’s travel ban in June – decides in her favor, Simpson intends to sue the president independently for fraud, which she hopes could see him give evidence before a jury. “I believed in a jury trial,” Simpson told the Guardian. “It looked like we had such a strong case for trial after seven years of litigation.” Simpson, a bankruptcy attorney who took courses at Trump University in 2010, had planned to sue on her own before learning of, and joining, one of the three class action suits. In her appeal, her lawyers allege that she was told she would be able to be excluded from a settlement if she wished. Instead, Simpson says, she was not given forewarning of the $25m settlement with the president-elect – only learning of it from the media – and was not given a chance to withdraw. It was just all upsell. It was all a scam. It turned out it was a lot of cheerleading for Donald Trump and his successes Sherri Simpson “We’re asking them to rule that there is no authority to approve a settlement in this case, because it did not allow the class members to opt out – to say yes or no to the settlement,” said Gary B Friedman, representing Simpson with fellow attorney Deepak Gupta. Trump University, a for-profit company that was not an accredited university or college, launched in 2005 with Trump promising that “students” would be mentored by hand-picked staff. A Trump University “playbook” released in May 2016 showed that one of the pledges to enrollees read: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.” The fraud lawsuits alleged that students learnt nothing of the sort, despite being encouraged to pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend weekend seminars. Simpson, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said she received a leaflet through the mail in 2010 and eventually ended up spending $19,000 on tuition. “What I found from the very beginning was that it was just all upsell,” she said. “It was all a scam. It turned out it was a lot of cheerleading for Donald Trump and his successes.” Friedman said the ninth circuit had granted “expedited treatment” of Simpson’s appeal, with a verdict expected in late summer or early fall. If the court rules that Simpson should not have been included in the settlement, she will be free to pursue her own lawsuit against Trump. She has said she will not settle out of court. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump attacks judge overseeing Trump University case The $25m payout reached in 2016 was hailed as a victory by lawyers including New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who brought one of the three lawsuits involved. It is unclear what would happen to the 6,000 people involved in the settlement if Simpson were to win her appeal. Trump University – and the associated lawsuits – became an issue in the Republican primaries and the presidential campaign, with opponents releasing ads which featured some disgruntled former students. President-elect: I had to settle Trump University case 'to focus on our country' Read more In May 2016 a federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, made public more than 400 “playbooks”, which showed how staff were instructed to get people to accrue credit card debt to pay for tuition fees, and ordered to target financial weaknesses in a bid to sell further courses. Trump, who launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending “rapists” to the US, attacked Curiel over the release. “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump,” Trump said at a rally. “A hater. He’s a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing ... [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican.” Curiel was born in Indiana.

"New details of Russia election hacking raise questions about Obama's response","Barack Obama received an “intelligence bombshell” from the CIA last August warning him that Russian president Vladimir Putin was directing a hacking campaign to tip the presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor, the Washington Post reported on Friday. Based on interviews with more than three dozen current and former senior US officials, the Post’s investigation is likely to renew questions about how Putin’s sneak attack on US democracy was able to happen on Obama’s watch. “By the way,” Trump tweeted on Thursday, “if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 election, it all took place during the Obama admin. Why didn’t they stop them?” Trump questions impartiality of Russia investigation chief Robert Mueller Read more The Post also reports that the Obama administration considered retaliatory options against Moscow including the release of intelligence that might embarrass Putin and planting “cyber weapons” in Russia’s infrastructure, but eventually settled on something less ambitious. Evidence of Russian meddling mounted as the November election neared. In July 2016, the FBI had opened an investigation of contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates and almost 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were dumped online by WikiLeaks. Trump himself told a press conference in late July: “They probably have her [Hillary Clinton’s] 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you’d see some beauties there.” The following month, according to the Post, an envelope with “eyes only” instructions was sent by courier from the CIA to the White House. Only Obama and three senior aides were permitted to see it. “Inside was an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Russian president Vladimir Putin’s direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the US presidential race,” the paper says. Putin had given specific instructions, the CIA report added, aimed at defeating or at least damaging Clinton and boosting Trump. The Post says the CIA package came with instructions that it be returned immediately after it was read, and meetings in the situation room followed the same protocols as planning sessions for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden to avoid leaks. In August, the paper reports, Obama confronted Putin directly, accompanied only be interpreters, at a meeting of world leaders in China. A senior aide tells the Post that Obama told Putin “we knew what he was doing and [he] better stop or else”. Putin demanded proof. According to the Post account, over the next five months the administration debated numerous ways to respond, ranging from cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure to the publication of material gathered by the CIA that might embarrass Putin to potentially crippling sanctions that officials said could “crater” the Russian economy. But eventually, some time after Trump’s stunning election win, Obama settled on “a modest package” combining measures that had been drawn up to punish Russia for other issues with economic sanctions “so narrowly targeted that even those who helped design them describe their impact as largely symbolic”. The Post adds: “Obama also approved a previously undisclosed covert measure that authorised planting cyber weapons in Russia’s infrastructure, the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the United States found itself in an escalating exchange with Moscow. The project, which Obama approved in a covert-action finding, was still in its planning stages when Obama left office. It would be up to President Trump to decide whether to use the capability.” On 7 October, meanwhile, the White House issued a delicately worded statement saying that the US intelligence community was “confident” that the Russian government was behind the hack of the DNC. But just an hour later, revelations broke of a video tape in which Trump boasted about groping women, quickly followed by a WikiLeaks dump of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The media’s attention focused elsewhere. Trump’s alleged ties to Russia have received so much attention, including investigations by a special counsel and two congressional committees, that the adequacy of the Obama administration’s response has largely escaped scrutiny. Trump admits for first time 'I am being investigated' over James Comey's firing Read more Obama and his senior advisers were concerned that any pre-election response could trigger an escalation from Putin, including a cyberattack on voting systems before and on election day, the Post writes. There were also concerns that any action would be interpreted as politically motivated on behalf of Obama’s fellow Democrat Clinton, potentially fuelling Trump’s repeated claims on the campaign trail that the election would be rigged. Denis McDonough, who was Obama’s chief of staff, defended the administration’s actions. “We set out from a first-order principle that required us to defend the integrity of the vote,” he told the Post. “Importantly, we did that. It’s also important to establish what happened and what they attempted to do so as to ensure that we take the steps necessary to stop it from happening again.” But others in the administration suggest that more could have been done. A former senior official involved in White House deliberations on Russia, who was not named by the Post, is quoted as saying: “It is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend. I feel like we sort of choked.” “The punishment did not fit the crime,” the former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, said of the US sanctions. Daniel Drezner, a professor of International Politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the story underscored what was “always Obama’s greatest weakness as a foreign policy president”. “To his credit he was always wary [to] first do no harm, which led him to not react immediately to crises and not necessarily want to take retaliatory action,” Drezner said. “But this is a case where he clearly moved too slowly, and I think failed to appreciate the magnitude of what was going on.” While Drezner said there was validity to the administration’s concern of appearing partial to Clinton, and of acting in a way that might cast scrutiny over the legitimacy of her presidency had she won, Obama could nonetheless have announced some countermeasures against Russia at an earlier stage aimed at limiting Moscow’s aggression. He also laid blame on Republicans, such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, for reportedly questioning the intelligence presented to them providing evidence of Russian interference in the election. “I think 15-20 years ago, the very fact that this intrusion had taken place would have generated significant political blowback,” Drezner said. “But conservatives and Trump supporters viewed Russia as an ally, rather than an actor intruding on American sovereignty. And that’s on us, that’s not on Russia.” Sign up for the Minute email.

"I am announcing today that in this form I will not support it."  Heller and Cruz are both up for re-election in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who rolled out the legislation on Thursday, needs 50 votes to pass the bill to the House, with Vice President Mike Pence serving as the tie-breaking vote. But without the support of Paul, Cruz, Lee, Johnson, and now Heller, passage of the bill in its current form will be nearly impossible, unless Republicans can manage to draw Democratic votes, which is highly unlikely.  Related Image Expand / Collapse AP  (Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., in his office on Capitol Hill in 2011) "Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor," the joint statement from Cruz, Paul, Johnson and Lee said on Thursday. "There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system but it does not appear this draft, as written, will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal ObamaCare and lower their health care costs."  Related Image Expand / Collapse Reuters  (Sen. Rand Paul, R-K.Y., on Capitol Hill on March 7, 2017) Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday that if members who support the bill know they don't have the votes needed, discussion would begin earlier.  Related Image Expand / Collapse AP  (Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Capitol Hill ) "I didn't run on ObamaCare lite," Paul said. "I think we can do better than this --my hope is not to defeat the bill, but to make the bill better."  Paul added: "Now the discussions begin -- I think it could take longer than a week."  Related Image Expand / Collapse AP  (Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in Washington, D.C.) Cruz acknowledged that he had not yet had "the opportunity" to fully review the bill in its entirity, but said "there are components that give me encouragement and there are also components that are a cause for deep concern."  “I have been clear from day one that I want to get to yes,” Cruz told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. “Nobody has fought harder against ObamaCare in the Senate than I have, but we have to actually have legislation that fixes the underlying problem.” Cruz said the current draft doesn’t do “nearly enough,” and would be a “disaster politically.” Cruz said that key components to “get everyone to yes” are lowering premiums, and giving the states flexibility.  Related Image Expand / Collapse Reuters  (Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in Washington, D.C. on March 29, 2017) Senate Republicans released the 142-page draft of their version of a "repeal and replace" health care plan on Thursday titled, “Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017,” which eliminates a majority of ObamaCare provisions, already drawing backlash from Senate Democrats, and even some congressional Republicans. The bill could go to a vote as early as next week, after the Congressional Budget Office reviews and gives a score to the new plan, but McConnell did not announce a specific timeline for consideration. The Congressional Budget Office expects to have a score for the draft “early next week.” The bill repeals key components of ObamaCare, and manages to maintain some "crucial" conservative items congressional Republicans were looking for, like a cut to Planned Parenthood funding. GOP SENATORS UNVEIL OBAMACARE OVERHAUL But despite the early GOP-opposition, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he’s “glad the process is moving forward.” “The Senate discussion draft is available for everyone to review,” Grassley said. “There will be a full debate before the Senate, with the ability for senators of both parties to offer amendments.” But Democrats, as expected, are slamming the bill—and most are hanging on comments made by President Trump earlier this week, suggesting the House bill, called the American Health Care Act, was “mean.” “The President said the Senate bill needs heart, the President says the House bill was mean,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Thursday after the bill was rolled out. “The Senate version is meaner—the House bill is a wolf, but this bill is a wolf with sharper teeth -- it’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” .@POTUS said the House #Trumpcare bill was "mean." RT if you agree the Senate GOP's version is meaner. pic.twitter.com/FkBNRSLRYA— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 23, 2017 At the White House, the president remained consistent in his comment from earlier in the week, and said he hoped to get “something done” with “heart.” “We’d love to have some Democratic support, but they’re obstructionist,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’ll get something done and it’ll be something with heart and very meaningful.” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the bill is “even worse than expected” and called it “by far the most harmful piece of legislation I have seen in my lifetime.” “Our job now is to rally millions of Americans against this disastrous bill to make sure it does not pass the Senate,” Sanders said. Despite Sanders’, and other Democrats’ criticisms, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said the bill makes “no change” in current law when it comes to “protecting people with pre-existing conditions.” McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday that Democrats “made it clear early on” that they “did not want to work with us,” but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he had “never been asked.” “It is not just a fiction, it is a gross fiction,” Wyden said. Still, many members have yet to read the 142-page legislation in its entirety, with some Republicans hesitant to “forecast” votes, prior to reading the bill in full. WHAT'S IN THE SENATE PROPOSAL: KEY PROVISIONS OF BETTER CARE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2017 “I don’t know,” Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., told Fox News. “We’ve got a lot of work to do.” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, already has “a number of concerns,” according to her spokesperson, and plans to read the bill in full.   “She has a number of concerns and will be particularly interested in examining the forthcoming CBO analysis on the impact on insurance coverage, the effect on insurance premiums, and the changes in the Medicaid program,” Collins’ spokeswoman Annie Clark said. McConnell said that when legislation comes to the floor, it will present Senate Democrats “another opportunity to do what’s right for the American people.”  Fox News'  Peter Doocy,Chad Pergram, Mike Emanuel, Jason Donner contributed to this report.

"Qatar given 10 days to meet 13 sweeping demands by Saudi Arabia","Saudi Arabia and its allies have issued a threatening 13-point ultimatum to Qatar as the price for lifting a two-week trade and diplomatic embargo of the country, in a marked escalation of the Gulf’s worst diplomatic dispute in decades. The onerous list of demands includes stipulations that Doha close the broadcaster al-Jazeera, drastically scale back cooperation with Iran, remove Turkish troops from Qatar’s soil, end contact with groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and submit to monthly external compliance checks. Qatar has been given 10 days to comply with the demands or face unspecified consequences. Qatar explainer Saudi Arabia and the other nations leading the blockade – the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt – launched an economic and diplomatic blockade on the energy-rich country a fortnight ago, initially claiming the Qatari royal family had licensed the funding of terrorism across the Middle East for decades. Since then, the allies appear to be pushing for the isolation of Iran and the suppression of dissenting media in the region. The list of demands, relayed to Qatar via mediators from Kuwait, represents the first time Saudi Arabia has been prepared to put the bloc’s previously amorphous grievances in writing. Their sweeping nature would, if accepted, represent an effective end to Qatar’s independent foreign policy. According to one of the points, Qatar would have to “align itself with other Arabs and the Gulf, militarily, politically, socially and economically, as well as in financial matters”. The UAE’s foreign secretary, Anwar Gargash, insisted the anti-Qatar alliance is not seeking to impose regime change. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Qatar will see the demands as the basis for serious negotiations. Qatar has become reliant on Turkey and Iran for food imports since the embargo was imposed on 5 June and insists with its huge wealth it can survive the embargo for an indefinite period. Gargash blamed Qatar for the “childish” leak of its 13 demands and called it either an “attempt to undermine serious mediation or yet another sign of callous policy. “It would be wiser that [Qatar] deal seriously with the demands and concerns of the neighbours or a divorce will take place,” he said. How some of the key countries compare Qatar faces a choice of either stability and prosperity or isolation, he said, adding: “Perhaps the solution is in parting ways.” In a sign that the UK does not regard the demands as reasonable, foreign secretary Boris Johnson said on Friday: “Gulf unity can only be restored when all countries involved are willing to discuss terms that are measured and realistic. “The UK calls upon the Gulf states to find a way of de-escalating the situation and lifting the current embargo and restrictions which are having an impact on the everyday lives of people in the region.” US policy towards Qatar so far has been marked by confusion. President Donald Trump has appeared to take credit for the Saudi embargo and described Qatar as a haven for terrorism. By contrast, the State Department under Rex Tillerson has twice upbraided Saudi Arabia’s approach to Qatar and questioned its true motives in sparking the diplomatic crisis. In recent days the State Department has been pressing Saudi to specify the actions Qatar must take to see the embargo lifted, but warned that those demands need to be “reasonable and actionable”. Qatar diplomatic crisis: what are Trump's financial links to the region? Read more On Friday a White House spokesman told the Guardian: “The United States is still accessing the list and we are in communication with all parties. As we have said, we want to see the parties resolve this dispute and restore unity among our partners in the region, while ensuring all countries are stopping funding for terrorist groups.” The State Department spokesperson also declined to take a position on the specific Saudi demands, focusing instead on the need for the involved parties to resolve the dispute themselves through dialogue. “We understand the Kuwaitis, in their mediation capacity, have delivered a list of demands to the Qataris,” a spokesperson said. “We encourage all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive, diplomatic discussions.” The US has a major military base in Qatar and risks seeing Qatar forced into an alliance with Iran if its enforced isolation continues, an outcome that would be a major strategic blow to Washington as well as a further threat to the security of the region. Qatar’s UN ambassador, Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif al-Thani, said the allegations that her country supports terrorism are “sabotaging our relationship with the world, with the west, tarnishing our reputation in a way by using the terrorism card”. She said: “The blockade they have imposed is illegal. They used the terrorism card as a way of attracting attention. But the main objectives are more about criticising our media, al-Jazeera, and our openness.” Al-Thani added: “We are small, but we have integrity.” She said on US broadcaster CBS that she believed the Saudi positioning was softening, but not that of the UAE. She hopes for a resolution but fears a prolonged chill: “They continue to escalate even though both Kuwait and the United States are playing an important role. We are confident of the US position toward the blockade.” Al-Jazeera has condemned the call for its closure as “nothing but an attempt to end freedom of expression in the region, and suppress the right to information”. Qatar map Rachael Jolley, the editor of Index on Censorship, said: “From its treatment of blogger Raif Badawi to its tightly controlled media environment, the Saudi authorities must not be able to dictate access to information for the public in other countries. Al-Jazeera must not be used as a bargaining chip.” But the Saudi-led alliance regards the Arabic wing of al-Jazeera, the most widely watched broadcaster in the Arab world, as a propaganda tool for Islamists that also undermines support for their governments. The list of demands also called for other Doha-supported news outlets to be shut, including the New Arab and Middle East Eye. Other key demands mapped out by Saudi include Qatar severing all ties with terrorist groups, specifically the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al-Qaida and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The ultimatum calls for the handing over of designated terrorists and other individuals by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. All contacts with the political opposition inside Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain would have to be halted with all files handed over that detail Qatar’s prior contacts with, and support for, opposition groups. Qatar’s links with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s main adversary, would have to be confined only to trade allowed under the international sanctions regime and approved by the Gulf Co-operation Council. Cutting ties to Iran would prove incredibly difficult – Qatar shares with Iran a massive offshore natural gas field, which supplies the small nation that will host the 2022 Fifa World Cup with much of its wealth. Human cost of the Qatar crisis: 'families are being torn apart' Read more Qatar insists it does not fund terrorists, and has previously said that the embargo is a punishment for following an independent foreign policy more sympathetic to the principles of the Arab spring than that of its neighbours. Qatar would also be required to accept monthly external audits after agreeing to the demands, then once per quarter during the second year. It would also have to agree to be monitored annually for compliance for 10 years. Turkey’s defence minister rejected suggestions that Doha should review its military base in Qatar and said demands for its closure represent interference in Ankara’s relations with the Gulf state. Speaking on Thursday, before the 13 demands were tabled, Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said his country had always abided by international laws and played a key role in the international coalition fighting Isis. Additional reporting by Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington The 13 demands in full Curb diplomatic ties with Iran and close its diplomatic missions there. Expel members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and cut off any joint military cooperation with Iran. Only trade and commerce with Iran that complies with US and international sanctions will be permitted. Sever all ties to “terrorist organisations”, specifically the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al-Qaida and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Formally declare those entities as terrorist groups. Shut down al-Jazeera and its affiliate stations. Shut down news outlets that Qatar funds, directly and indirectly, including Arabi21, Rassd, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed and Middle East Eye. Immediately terminate the Turkish military presence in Qatar and end any joint military cooperation with Turkey inside Qatar. Stop all means of funding for individuals, groups or organisations that have been designated as terrorists by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, the US and other countries. Hand over “terrorist figures” and wanted individuals from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain to their countries of origin. Freeze their assets, and provide any desired information about their residency, movements and finances. End interference in sovereign countries’ internal affairs. Stop granting citizenship to wanted nationals from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Revoke Qatari citizenship for existing nationals where such citizenship violates those countries’ laws. Stop all contacts with the political opposition in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Hand over all files detailing Qatar’s prior contacts with and support for those opposition groups. Pay reparations and compensation for loss of life and other, financial losses caused by Qatar’s policies in recent years. The sum will be determined in coordination with Qatar. Consent to monthly audits for the first year after agreeing to the demands, then once per quarter during the second year. For the following 10 years, Qatar would be monitored annually for compliance. Align itself with the other Gulf and Arab countries militarily, politically, socially and economically, as well as on economic matters, in line with an agreement reached with Saudi Arabia in 2014. Agree to all the demands within 10 days of it being submitted to Qatar, or the list becomes invalid.

"Trump slams Obama for doing 'nothing' about Russia before the election","President Trump in an interview released Friday criticizes former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaTrump notes 'election meddling by Russia' in tweet criticizing Obama Trump slams Obama for doing 'nothing' about Russia before the election OPINION: Dear media, Americans don't care about Obama's legacy MORE over Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, accusing Obama of doing “nothing” before the election. “Well I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it. But nobody wants to talk about that,” Trump said in an interview airing in full Sunday on “Fox and Friends Weekend.” “The CIA gave him information on Russia a long time before they even -- before the election. And I hardly see it. It's an amazing thing," Trump continued. "In other words, the question is, if he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it.  But you don't read that. It's quite sad," Trump said. Trump reiterated in a tweet that the Obama administration "knew far in advance" of the election about Russia's meddling but "did nothing." Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2017 The comments came a day after Trump tweeted, asking why the Obama administration did not "stop" Russia during the election. By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT Some Democrats have joined in on criticizing the Obama administration’s handling of Russian election meddling. “It was inadequate. I think they could have done a better job informing the American people of the extent of the attack,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, called the penalties imposed on Russia for meddling “barely a slap on the wrist.” The Obama administration is facing fresh criticism after The Washington Post reported that Obama was slow and cautious in responding to Russian election interference. Some officials were reportedly wary of taking action before the election, which was dominated by Trump making claims on the campaign trail of the election being "rigged" against him. The Obama administration ultimately acted in December, a month after Trump won the election, with Obama approving new economic sanctions and expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. “It is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend,” the Post quoted one Obama administration official as saying. “I feel like we sort of choked.”  A former senior Obama administration official on Friday slammed "hypocrisy" from lawmakers criticizing the past administration's handling of Russia. “Our critics are judging our actions in mid-2016 based on what we know by mid-2017. It’s an unfair standard,” Ned Price, a former spokesman for the National Security Council, told MSNBC’s Greta van Susteren. “Knowing what we now know, we went on an aggressive push to make it clear both privately to the Russians that we knew what they were up to through multiple warnings, through multiple channels, over the course of many weeks, and to the American people,” he said.

"Guantanamo detainee Hambali charged in Bali bombing","A US military court has charged an Indonesian detainee at Guantanamo Bay in connection with the 2002 bombing in Bali, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press news agency. The detainee, known as Hambali, was also charged in connection with an attack on the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2003. According to rules of the US military commission, a military court will later decide whether a trial will be held. The October 12, 2002, Bali resort island attacks, which occurred near the US consulate, killed 202 people. A suicide bomber blew himself up inside a nightclub jammed with tourists at a popular beach, killing many instantly and forcing others to run outside. Thousands gather for Bali memorial services Another suicide bomber detonated a massive bomb loaded in a car parked on the street in front of two clubs. In the second bombing, which occurred on August 5, 2003, the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta was targeted because the building was conducive to the type of bomb that was being constructed. The perpetrators believed there would be a large American presence at the hotel and they "believed it would have the biggest overall impact", the charging documents said. The August 5, 2003, car bomb in front of the hotel in Jakarta killed 12 people and wounded 150. Last fall, a US government review board rejected the release of Hambali, saying he continues to be a "significant threat to the security of the United States". Hambali, whose real name is Encep Nurjaman, appeared before the board in August by video link, seeking his release after being held 10 years at the base without charge. The Pentagon described him in a profile released before the hearing as a leader of the Southeast Asia-based Jemaah Islamiyah armed group. Hambali also is alleged to have had links to al-Qaida. Hambali has been charged with murder and attempted murder in violation of the law of war; intentionally causing serious bodily injury; terrorism; attacking civilians; and related charges. Australia's reaction Australia on Saturday welcomed the reported US charges against Hambali. "I hope that should this prosecution succeed, it will bring closure to those devastated by the loss of loved ones, family and friends," Julie Bishop, Australia's foreign minister, said. "It has been a scar on the hearts of all Australians since these attacks occurred in 2002." WATCH: Bali bombing - Nine years later For Australia, which suffered the most casualties, the Bali bombs were the worst peacetime attack on its citizens. Seven Americans and 38 Indonesians citizens were also among the dead. Bishop said Australia would provide whatever support it could, but did not support the death penalty. "Those responsible for the murder of 202 people, including 88 Australians, should be prosecuted, should receive the severest of punishment and should never be freed," she said.

"'I wanted the building to fly': Renzo Piano's Santander gallery opens","Two great hull-like forms stand on the seafront in Santander, northern Spain, clad in thousands of pearlescent discs, like a pair of ships encrusted with exotic barnacles. Jacked up 6 metres (20ft) into the air on slender white pillars, allowing views through to the water, this is the new Centro Botín, an €80m (£70m) art gallery by Renzo Piano, which opened to the public on Friday. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Italian architect Renzo Piano visits the Centro Botín the day before its opening. Photograph: Pedro Puente Hoyos/Enrico Cano “From the very beginning, I wanted the building to fly,” says the 79-year-old Italian architect, who has built 25 museums and galleries around the world. The levitation trick here was in part a response to local outcries that this big ark of art would block the view of the sea. In reality, it has done anything but. Instead, the roaring coastal road, which had long severed the city from the water, has been buried, allowing the neighbouring Pereda Gardens to double in size, spreading over the sunken road to meet Piano’s shiny vessel and allow easy access to the waterfront for the first time. The building is formed of two lobes, prised apart in the middle, where staircases and gantries zigzag to a roof terrace, designed with a nautical air familiar to much of Piano’s work. One half houses 2,500 sq m of gallery space over two levels (compared with about 11,000 sq m in 19 galleries at Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Bilbao, with vast picture windows looking out to sea, giving the feeling of being on a ship’s bridge. The other side contains workshops and a 300-seat auditorium for concerts, festivals and classes in music, dance and cookery, in keeping with the centre’s aim for art with a social mission. The gallery opens with an exhibition of Goya’s drawings and a crowd-pleasing show of interactive installations by Carsten Höller, while a third exhibition draws together works from the Botín collection, amassed over the past two decades, including by Mona Hatoum and Tacita Dean. An exhibition of African artist Julie Mehretu’s drawings and paintings will open in October. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The view from under the gallery. The pearlescent discs adorning parts of the building resemble glittering barnacles. Photograph: Enrico Cano The project has been privately funded by the Bótin Foundation, a charitable organisation established in 1964 by the aristocratic Bótin family, owners of Santander bank – whose name appropriately means “booty”. Former bank chair Emilio Bótin, who commissioned the building, died in 2014, the year his sparkling coffers of art were originally intended to open. “The idea was not to create an icon like Bilbao,” says Vicente Todolí, president of foundation’s visual arts committee and former director of Tate Modern. “The building is not trying to show off or give the impression that Santander is more than it is.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The glass containers housing the art gallery. Photograph: Enrico Cano With a population of 170,000, the culturally conservative Santander is about half the size of nearby Bilbao, and Piano has created a suitably modest addition to the waterfront. His pearly containers join a pleasingly jumbled promenade that includes the postmodern fortress of the Cantabria Festival Palace, designed by Sáenz de Oiza in 1985, and some great beaches, adding another reason to visit this charming port city – and providing a low-key foil to Gehry’s thrashing metallic fish.

"Radiohead mesmerise fans at Glastonbury with a wayward, but compelling, set","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thom Yorke thanked the Eavis family "for having us at your lovely farm today" Absorbing, challenging and achingly beautiful - Radiohead delivered a typically Radiohead sort of set for Glastonbury's opening night. The Oxford quintet emerged, bathed in white light, to the haunting piano refrain of Daydreaming, from last year's A Moon Shaped Pool album. Two hours and 25 songs later, they closed with Karma Police, singing: "For a minute there, I lost myself." It felt like a perfect metaphor for the band's power to transport an audience. The performance came on the 20th anniversary of Radiohead's first headline set at Glastonbury. That show, which took place just weeks after they released OK Computer, has often been called the festival's best ever. Glastonbury quiz: Test your knowledge However, frontman Thom Yorke recently told BBC 6 Music he had been on the verge of walking off the stage, after the band's monitors exploded, meaning they could not hear each other. "I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist] and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'" he recalled. "He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' I went, 'Good point.'" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionThom Yorke on Radiohead's 1997 Glastonbury performance BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen Bradley Cooper surprises Glastonbury fans Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Full Glastonbury line-up There were no such problems on Friday night, as the band embarked on a career-spanning set that held their experimental and anthemic qualities in perfect balance. Airbag was thrilling, Pyramid Song devastating, and Everything In It's Right Place a pulsing, twisted Radiohead version of a club classic. They even pulled out the much-maligned Creep - the angsty, teenage anthem that gave them early success, but became a millstone around their necks as they matured into a fearlessly experimental art-rock outfit. Image copyright Getty Images Things got political - briefly - during No Surprises, where the lyric "bring down the government, they don't speak for us," elicited a huge cheer from the festival's left-leaning audience. As the song ended, Yorke commented: "See you later, Theresa. Just shut the door on your way out." That aside, the frontman rarely spoke during the set, except to thank Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis "for having us at your lovely farm today". "Thank you very much for coming to this field to listen to us this evening," he added during the encore. "Probably we'll see you in some other fields over the weekend." Image copyright OLI SCARFF Radiohead were preceded on the Pyramid Stage by indie-dance band The xx, whose spiralling, hypnotic songs soundtracked dusk on Worthy Farm. Immediately before them, rock group Royal Blood celebrated with champagne on stage as their second album, How Did We Get So Dark, entered the charts at number one. Speaking to the BBC, singer Mike Kerr said the band were bowled over by the two events converging. "We definitely have a sense that this is a one-off thing. It's something I'll look back on as a very special time." Elsewhere on Friday, there were sets from Sleaford Mods, Clean Bandit, Dizzee Rascal, The Lemon Twigs and Flaming Lips.

Once she emerged onto the stage, she dedicated a recently-released song, The Louvre, to anyone in the audience who was harbouring a secret crush. "Shut your eyes and listen to the song, and just will it to happen," she said. "Maybe they will kiss you tonight. Who knows?" Image copyright Sarah Jeynes Image caption The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 Actor Bradley Cooper appeared on the Pyramid Stage to film a scene for his new movie, a remake of the musical A Star Is Born. He then introduced Kris Kristofferson, who was watched from the side of the stage by fellow Hollywood star Brad Pitt. Johnny Depp also joined the singer-songwriter, who was 81 yesterday, playing guitar on one of the songs. Depp caused controversy on Thursday, as he joked about assassinating Donald Trump during an appearance at Glastonbury. He has since apologised. Former footballer David Beckham also made his first visit to Glastonbury, to help organiser Michael Eavis launch a new social housing project.

"Cladding fire tests failed by 27 high-rise blocks","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionWatch: Camden resident confronts council chief Cladding on 27 tower blocks in 15 council areas in England has failed fire safety tests, the government says. This comes after Camden Council became the first authority to evacuate residents over fire safety concerns, asking people living in four high-rise buildings to leave late on Friday. The council said it had no option but to move residents of 650 flats on the Chalcots estate while work takes place. Theresa May said "necessary" steps will be taken to find people accommodation. By Saturday morning, 83 people had refused to leave their homes. The council's Labour leader, Georgia Gould, said the council had acted "as swiftly as we possibly can" to ensure people's safety. Ms Gould said the fire service "told us they could not guarantee our residents' safety in those blocks". "I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything and I just don't believe we can take any risk with our residents' safety and I have to put them first. "I offered to pay for fire stations to be stationed outside all of those blocks so we could have a couple of days to get the work done but the message was there was absolutely nothing I could do to make those blocks safe that night." She said that if people still choose to not leave their homes then it would "become a matter for the fire services".

Other high-rise buildings, such as some used by the NHS, are also being tested. The Department for Communities and Local Government have named six of the 15 local authorities where high-rise buildings have failed fire safety tests as: Camden - where residents have been evacuated from four blocks on the Chalcots estate Brent - where the council has said only one out of its 37 high-rise blocks has cladding Hounslow - where Clements Court tower in Cranford is to have outer cladding removed Manchester - where 78 panels are being removed from one area of the Village 135 development in Wythenshawe Plymouth - where three blocks on the Mount Wise Tower estate were found to have cladding made from similar material to Grenfell Tower Portsmouth - where the city council is removing cladding from Horatia House and Leamington House in Somerstown The estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79. The Metropolitan Police say manslaughter, health and safety, and fire safety charges will be considered in relation to that blaze. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. Camden Council says it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate. It also said there were concerns about the insulation of gas pipes going into flats, and fire doors. The council initially announced the evacuation of one tower block, Taplow, but later extended the move to all five tower blocks it had checked. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the council then announced that one of the five - Blashford - did not need to be evacuated, and residents could return, because it is smaller and has "several different design elements". At the scene By Cherry Wilson, BBC News Children jump on the climbing frames and kick around a ball in the playground outside Swiss Cottage leisure centre. It would seem like a typical Saturday morning for families, except many are laden with bags or suitcases after leaving their homes. Locals say they are weary, after a chaotic night of mixed messages about whether or not they can stay in their homes. Pamela Woodward, 72, and her husband are walking away from the centre with two black suitcases, after being told they will be put up in a hotel. They stayed in their tower block last night after being told at 2am that someone would be back to collect them - but no-one returned. Pamela said: "It's disgusting. We've lived here for 30 years and there's been two fires since the cladding was fitted and they've all been contained. "I think there has been a big cock-up. I feel terrible. I just want to be at home. I've been up all night waiting for them." The council has secured 270 hotel rooms so far. Emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. "We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation," the council said. The decision to evacuate the buildings was made at 18:30 BST on Friday. The work is expected to take three to four weeks. Residents will be allowed in at the weekend to collect more possessions under escort from the fire brigade. How the residents reacted Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionCamden residents react to tower block evacuations Teacher Kim Price, who lives in Blashford tower with her 14-year-old son, said: "We've had two letters in two days saying 'you're not safe' then 'you're safe'. I don't really know what to do." Edward Strange said the evacuation was a "complete overreaction", given that two previous fires in the block were easily contained. "I've got a young daughter, a wife and a cat, I've also got a job. They said it'd take four to six weeks. If the council says four to six weeks it'll take four to six months." Peter Bertram, 94, who has lived on the estate for 46 years, said: "My neighbour told me 'Get this and that'. It happened so quick, I don't have the energy for that now." Confusion as evacuation begins Bob O'Toole, chairman of Chalcots Estate residents' association, told BBC Breakfast that contractors had been working overnight in several of the tower blocks. "A lot of people are annoyed because of the way [the evacuation] was done. They're saying it was left too late in the evening. But Camden Council didn't get the information till late, and they acted on that as quickly as possible." Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionSajid Javid: "Absolutely the right decision" to evacuate buildings Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the local fire service for the Chalcots Estate found multiple other failures in fire safety and, as a result, had made "this quite correct decision". "Public safety is absolutely paramount, you cannot put a price on people's lives. So local authorities have to do whatever it takes to get their buildings safe." Image copyright AFP Image caption The estate recently underwent a £66m refurbishment Image caption Samples from the tower blocks on the Chalcots estate were examined this week Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said people who were in towers where cladding was being investigated would be "living in fear". "People need to give significant weight to the voice of residents, and if they do want to be moved, if they feel unsafe and haven't been reassured, then provision should be put in place [to move them]." Camden Council agreed a contract with Rydon Construction to refurbish the Chalcots estate in May 2006 at a cost of £66m. The work took more than three-and-a-half years. Five towers received new cladding and 711 flats were modernised with new wiring, heating, kitchens and bathrooms.

"We are being allowed to stay in our flats until the work starts on Monday, as the fire services have said they are safe enough for us to stay. The council have put 24-hour security in each block until work starts." Friday night's announcement came as the Metropolitan Police said the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests.

"Andrea Leadsom's call for 'patriotic' Brexit coverage prompts anger","Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, has come under fire for calling on broadcasters to be “a bit patriotic” in their Brexit coverage. The outgoing Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, described Leadsom, who stood for the leadership of the Conservative party last year, as “sinister” for her comments on the BBC’s Newsnight. Leadsom said: “It would be helpful if broadcasters were willing to be a bit patriotic. The country took a decision, this government is determined to deliver on that decision.” Emily Maitlis, who was presenting the show, asked Leadsom if she was accusing broadcasters of being unpatriotic . “Are you accusing me of being unpatriotic for questioning how negotiations are going, questioning whether you have the position of strength that she said she wanted?” she said. Leadsom replied: “I’m not accusing you of anything, Emily. I’m simply saying we all need to pull together as a country. We took a decision a year ago today to leave the European Union, we have a very strong hand and we are very well prepared for the negotiations.” Farron said: “This is a sinister threat to the free media. How dare Andrea Leadsom tell the press what they should think. This isn’t a George Orwell book. She needs to apologise for these comments and realise what she said was frankly stupid.” Leadsom previously caused controversy when, during the Tory leadership battle after David Cameron’s resignation, she told the Times: “Genuinely I feel that being a mum means you have a very real stake in the future of our country, a tangible stake.” The comments provoked uproar and caused Leadsom to withdraw from the race, because Theresa May had previously spoken about how she and her husband, Philip, had been affected by being unable to have children. Leadsom, a leading Brexit campaigner, also faced challenges over her CV during the leadership contest, particularly some of the roles she had held in the City. On Friday, EU leaders poured cold water on the prime minister’s hopes for an early deal on citizens’ rights at a Brussels summit. Donald Tusk, the European council president, said her plan fell below Brussels’ expectations and could worsen the situation of the 3 million EU citizens living in the UK. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said they did not represent a “breakthrough” in the Brexit talks. May insisted her offer was “fair and serious” and should reassure EU nationals in the UK that their lives will not be affected.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/24/andrea-leadsom-patriotic-brexit-coverage-newsnight-eu-negotiations,2017-06-24 09:14:02
"Exclusive: Overruling diplomats, U.S. to drop Iraq, Myanmar from child soldiers' list","By Jason Szep and Matt Spetalnick | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON In a highly unusual intervention, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to remove Iraq and Myanmar from a U.S. list of the world's worst offenders in the use of child soldiers, disregarding the recommendations of State Department experts and senior U.S. diplomats, U.S. officials said. The decision, confirmed by three U.S. officials, would break with longstanding protocol at the State Department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the Trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights. Tillerson overruled his own staff’s assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in Asia and the Middle East who wanted to keep Iraq and Myanmar on the list, said the officials, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations. Tillerson also rejected an internal State Department proposal to add Afghanistan to the list, the three U.S. officials said. One official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the Pentagon to avoid complicating assistance to the Iraqi and Afghan militaries, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamist militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving U.S. military aid, training and U.S.-made weapons unless the White House issues a waiver. Human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting, which was expected to be announced on Tuesday, the officials said, as part of the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. A State Department official said the TIP report's contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department "does not discuss details of internal deliberations." The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that "no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers" in order for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume. In the lead-up to Tuesday's report, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which researches the issue and helps shape U.S. policy on it, along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in Asia and the Middle East concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list, the officials said. Officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last-minute changes. BETRAYING CHILDREN Human Rights Watch said removing Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list would be a "completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses." The decision also would put the Trump administration at odds with the United Nations, which continues to list the Myanmar military, along with seven ethnic armed groups, on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers. "What's particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the U.N. in Burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited" by the Myanmar military, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Rights groups have long accused Myanmar of using child soldiers. Bordering both China and India, Myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the United States at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by China, which has sought closer relations with its neighbor. Iraq, which has received more than $2 billion in U.S. arms and training over the last three years, was added to the State Department’s "Child Soldier Prevention Act List" in 2016. However, the flow of U.S. assistance has continued. Former President Barack Obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly, including last year to Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and others out of 10 countries on the list. Last year's State Department report said some militias of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Shi'ite Muslim factions with ties to the Iraqi government and backed by Iran, "recruited and used child soldiers." The report said that despite the PMF being funded by the government, Baghdad struggled to control all of its factions. "The government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the PMF and PMF-affiliated militias."     Human Rights Watch said in January that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one Iraqi refugee camp since last spring.     The broader TIP report, the first of Trump's presidency, is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his "America First" approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments, especially strategically important ones, for human rights violations at home. The Obama administration, while more vocal about political repression around the world, also faced criticism from human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers that decisions on annual human trafficking rankings had become increasingly politicized.

"Ebola virus burial teams may have 'saved thousands of lives'","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionTulip Mazumdar's video diary of her day with the burial team They were ordinary people doing an extraordinary job in extremely dangerous times. Now new research suggests Red Cross volunteers who helped bury most of the bodies of Ebola victims in West Africa could have prevented more than 10,000 cases of the deadly disease. More than 28,000 people were infected with Ebola in 2014-2015. Of those, 11,310 people died. The worst affected countries were Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A major part of the response was ensuring the safe burials of people who had died of Ebola. The bodies of victims were particularly toxic. Ebola: A day with the burial team Ebola volunteers offered group therapy in Sierra Leone (video) Ebola nurse Pauline Cafferkey meets disease survivors Community funerals, where people helped wash the bodies of their loved ones, contributed to so many people becoming infected in the earlier stages of the outbreak. Image copyright EPA Image caption Many Ebola burial workers were ordinary West Africans, such as teachers and college students Image copyright Mark Georgiou Image caption Some Ebola burial workers were stigmatised in their communities because of their work Within months, the epidemic had become the worst public health emergency of modern times. The study, published in the PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases journal, used statistical modelling to measure the impact of the Red Cross safe and dignified burial programme. Researchers focussed on 45 unsafe community burials and the 310 people who were identified as having had contact with the infected bodies. They found, on average, just over two people went on to develop Ebola for every unsafe community burial that took place. The bigger risk was to those who cared for a loved one with Ebola before their death. Researchers found many more infections could have been prevented if the sick were treated in hospital rather than by their families and communities. However, using these estimates, the study suggested safe and dignified burials by Red Cross volunteers prevented between 1,411 and 10,452 cases of Ebola. The authors said these are conservative estimates. They highlighted a number of limitations in the study, including the challenges of collecting very personal and sensitive information about funerals, and the length of time between when some of the burials took place and when the data was collected. Ending the war Hundreds of paid volunteers took on the grim task of collecting bodies from people's homes in full personal protective gear, while also having to manage the grieving families and communities.

Many carried out the relentless and dangerous work for months. Some were stigmatised in their communities, because people became scared they might bring the virus home with them. In reality, they were helping to stem world's worst ever Ebola outbreak. "It was very difficult work," said Red Cross volunteer Mohamed Kamara who I spent a day with as he collected bodies in Sierra Leone in January 2015. "It's good news that people realise the impact of what we did to help end the transmission of Ebola," he said while reacting to the findings of the study from the capital Freetown. "Some people didn't even want to come near us at that time. "But the team we worked with helped give us the courage to do this important work… and we ended this war."

"Dan Evans' career under threat after positive cocaine test","The build-up to Wimbledon was overshadowed by scandal on Friday night after Dan Evans, the British No. 3, confessed that he has tested positive for cocaine. Evans has a reputation as a rule-breaker, but this offence is on another level. He faces the theoretical maximum of a four-year ban, and will be lucky to get away with anything less than two. At 27, the very future of his career must stand in doubt. It is hard to remember a comparable instance in British tennis. It’s true that Greg Rusedski tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in 2004, but he later cleared his name after a tribunal ruled that he had ingested the substance inadvertently. Rusedski offered Evans a vote of support, saying “hopefully he can clean up his life and get help,” but other former players were more critical. “He has chucked his career away,” said the former British No. 1 Andrew Castle. “A massive mistake.” John Lloyd, who had been Evans’s first Davis Cup captain in 2010, said “The bottom line is how many chances do you get? He has had so many in his career, got in trouble and then came back. At some stage it has to change.” Evans has previously been dubbed the 'bad boy' of British tennis Credit: PA In an echo of Maria Sharapova’s own drug-related announcement on March 7, Evans called a press conference at a west London hotel on Friday afternoon. However, he wasn’t as self-assured as the icy Sharapova, who managed a joke about the ugliness of the carpet in the conference room. Evans arrived in the company of an agent and his girlfriend. After taking a deep breath to compose himself, he just about managed to read out a 90-second statement before fleeing the scene. Questions were not invited. “This is a very difficult day for me,” said Evans. “It is really important that you know this was taken out of competition and the context completely unrelated to tennis. I made a mistake and I must face up to it. “I do not condone for one second to anyone that this was acceptable behaviour. I have let a lot of people down – my family, my coach, my team, sponsors, British tennis and my fans. I can only deeply apologise from the bottom of my heart. It is a sad and humbling experience.” Richard Gasquet served a one-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2009 Credit: afp From a legal perspective, it will be important for Evans to show this was a recreational offence. While he claims to have taken the cocaine out of competition, the positive sample was collected after a match at April’s Barcelona Open.   Cocaine features as a banned stimulant on the WADA code, and there have long been stories that players in the 1980s used it on the court, applying the powder to their wristbands and then inhaling it between points. But these tales have never been substantiated, and the precedents work in Evans’s favour. Martina Hingis served only a two-year ban after her own positive test for cocaine in 2007. Richard Gasquet managed to keep the sentence down to one year in 2009, claiming that he had ingested the substance by kissing a woman called Pamela. Tennis drugs sagas Evans’s provisional ban will start on Monday, and the next stage will be a hearing convened by the International Tennis Federation, with the possibility of an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if he wishes. If this was going to happen to anyone in British tennis, Evans was the man most likely. He is a noted hellraiser whose behaviour has regularly brought him into conflict with the Lawn Tennis Association. His funding has either been withdrawn or cut back at regular intervals, usually because of a questionable attitude. In 2008, he was caught nightclubbing into the early hours on the eve of a junior doubles match at Wimbledon.   If the British game had a stock price, it would be falling through the floor, after recent setbacks on the court and now this devastating revelation. “We are very disappointed,” said the LTA’s performance director Simon Timson in a statement. “We absolutely condemn any form of drug-taking and will support the process which needs to take place.  We are in touch with Dan and we will offer appropriate guidance, support and education to him on how best to address the issues he now faces.” Evans is currently ranked 50 in the world Credit: Eddie Mulholland Evans should still have time to rebuild his career, but he is about to miss out on what should have been his prime years in the game. Tennis will have moved on by the time he returns to the match court. If, indeed, he returns at all. The news is all the more depressing because Evans had staged a dramatic career renaissance in the last two years, climbing from No. 772 in the world in April 2015 to his current position on the edge of the world’s top 50. In January, he beat the former US Open champion Marin Cilic on his way to the fourth round of the Australian Open – his deepest run at a grand slam. On the court, Evans is a gifted strokeplayer and a natural entertainer. Off it, he is a provocative character who contradicts the stuffy “strawberries and cream” stereotype of British tennis. The game will be the poorer for his absence, but he has no-one to blame but himself. Evans deleted his social media accounts before coming in to make his announcement, and the immediate outcry showed that this, at least, was a wise decision. His name will be forever tarnished by his offence. ",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/06/23/dan-evans-tests-positive-cocaine/,2017-06-24 08:03:03
"Grenfell Tower: Dozens of angry residents refuse to leave Camden estate evacuated over fire fears","A total of 83 households refused to leave their homes after Camden residents were evacuated amid safety fears. Approximately 4,000 people have been displaced after 650 households were told to leave the Chalcots estate after firefighters said they "could not guarantee our residents' safety", Council leader Georgia Gould said.

So, one year on from the fateful Brexit vote, what has the impact actually been, so far, on the economy and business?   The broader economy   On the night of the decision itself, the pound suffered its biggest one-day fall against the dollar on record as currency traders bet that leaving the EU would impose a long-term and permanent economic cost on Britain, hitting its lowest in 31 years at around $1.2117. The pound climbed back above $1.3 after Theresa May called her snap election and traders bet that she would be returned with a commanding majority, but has now given back all those gains. Today, the currency remains some 15 per cent below its level on 23 June last year at $1.2666. While the depreciation is a benefit for UK exporters, it also means the cost of imports has soared, which is the reason domestic inflation is now rising faster than workers’ pay, imposing a fresh squeeze on living standards. Inflation hit 2.9 per cent in May, its highest since June 2013 and is expected to peak above 3 per cent. Business investment has also suffered since the Brexit referendum, as firms have been affected by a cloud of uncertainty that has descended over the UK’s future trade arrangements with the rest of the EU – and the associated threat of tariffs and customs barriers. Investment fell by 0.9 per cent in the final quarter of last year, contributing to the first calendar year decline since 2009. According to the Bank of England, the level of business investment is expected to be around 25 per cent lower by 2019 relative to its pre-referendum forecasts, damaging our future productivity growth. The British consumer proved surprisingly resilient after the referendum – a resilience that was responsible for the fact that GDP growth carried on robustly and the UK avoided a recession. The economy actually grew by 0.7 per cent in the final quarter of 2017, faster than just about anyone had expected. Yet, since the turn of the year, there have been distinct signs of shoppers running out of steam as inflation bites. Retail sales, a crucial component of consumption, fell by 1.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, the biggest quarterly fall since 2010. This was a major contributor to the crash in GDP growth in the first quarter to just 0.2 per cent. Economists expect a slight pick-up in the second quarter growth rate, but most are downbeat about the UK’s near-term prospects, especially in light of the inconclusive general election result. A survey by the Institute of Directors pointed to a major slump in confidence among its members immediately after the vote, which bodes badly for investment. The mounting fears of businesses of a Brexit “cliff edge” have prompted the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, to start lobbying hard within Government for the UK to push for a transition deal in 2019 to allow commerce to continue in precisely the same way as it did before – at least until a proper UK-EU trade and customs deal can be concluded.   Banking and financial services In January, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange warned that Brexit could cost the City of London up to 230,000 jobs if the Government fails to provide a clear plan for after the split. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this January, UBS chairman Axel Weber said that about 1,000 of the Swiss bank’s 5,000 employees in London could be affected by Brexit, and HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said his bank will relocate staff responsible for generating around a fifth of its UK-based trading revenue to Paris. Goldman Sachs’ Europe chief executive, Richard Gnodde, said in March that the US bank would relocate hundreds of staff out of London even before any Brexit deal is struck, as part of its contingency plans. The company currently employs around 6,000 people in London. Others have already taken more drastic steps. Money transfer company Transferwise, one of the biggest fintech firms in Europe, said in early April that it will move its European headquarters from London to mainland Europe by March 2019 in order to keep access to the single market after Brexit. Other banks and insurance companies have said that they will be opening European subsidiaries, but while such a move will likely incur additional costs, it won’t necessarily mean job moves in every case. Just this weak, the Japanese investment bank Daiwa confirmed that its new EU base will be in Frankfurt, and that it will be shifting some staff out of its London office. The European Commission this month pushed ahead with plans to assert control over the clearing of euro-denominated derivatives, which could ultimately force tens of thousands of jobs out of London and break off a key part of the City’s infrastructure.   Auto industry The number of cars built in the UK hit a 17-year high last year and more cars are being exported from Britain than ever before, but a failure to establish proper trade deals after Brexit could damage the industry “beyond repair”, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) warned back in January. Generally, because of the car industry’s global exposure, its integrated EU supply chains and its dependence on workers from abroad, it is considered one of the sectors most vulnerable to a hard Brexit, defined as exit from the single market and the customs union. Britain moving to a World Trade Organisation tariffs regime after Brexit could lead to the introduction of a 10 per cent tariff on finished vehicles and a 4.5 per cent levy on component parts for cars. In March, a research study done by PA Consulting showed that if manufacturers pass these costs directly on to customers – and taking all the stages of production into account – the price tag for a new vehicle could soar by as much as £2,372 per car. That was echoed by Mike Hawes, the head of the SMMT, who predicted this week that the cost of imported cars could rise by £1,500 if tariffs were introduced. And some car production could ultimately depart too.  Nissan pressed ahead with a major planned UK investment at its Sunderland plant last October, but has also said it would re-evaluate its decision in light of the final Brexit outcome. Toyota pledged in March to go ahead with a £240m investment in its Derbyshire factory. But the Japanese firm also warned that “continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success”. BMW hinted in March that it may move production of the Mini from Oxford to continental Europe due to Brexit.   Construction and manufacturing Like the car industry, the global nature of the construction and manufacturing sector stands to lose a lot, especially if Brexit restricts the free movement of labour. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in a report published in March argued that almost 200,000 construction jobs could be slashed if Britain loses access to the European single market, jeopardising billions of pounds worth of infrastructure projects and dealing a sharp blow to major UK cities’ global competitiveness. In February, a study from consultancy firm KPMG showed that one in three manufacturing firms plan to shift some operations out of the UK as a result of Brexit. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry have also issued stark warnings about the possible impact of Brexit on certain industries. And the Brexit vote already seems to be impacting on the supply of EU workers to Britain. The Office for National Statistics estimated in May that long-term net migration was 248,000 in 2016, down a “statistically significant” 84,000 from 2015. Around 117,000 EU citizens left the UK in 2016, an increase of 31,000 on 2015 and the highest recorded estimate since 2009.   Food and drink More than half of the food we eat in the UK comes from abroad, meaning that the post-Brexit fall in the pound has been squeezing the food and drink industry since the pound started sliding in June. Suppliers have seen their costs jump and a lot of that is being passed on to consumers as supermarkets aim to keep prices as low as possible to protect profits. Last year, that tension over price rises resulted in a public spat between Tesco and Unilever. Britain’s biggest supermarket refused to accept price rises on hundreds of Unilever products, causing Marmite to become a symbol of the industry battle over price increases. Mondelez’s Cadbury products, Nestlé’s Nescafé, Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Bisto gravy, have since all hiked prices or said they were considering doing so. Other companies have been quietly shrinking the size of their products, a process that has become known as “shrinkflation”, whereby prices remain the same as portion sizes get smaller. Experts have also said that Brexit could have an impact on jobs within the food and retail industry. Ufi Ibrahim, the head of the British Hospitality Association warned in March that restaurants in the UK will need a decade to replace their EU staff with British employees after Brexit. The director of human resources at Pret a Manger told a parliamentary committee in March that only one in 50 job applications she receives is from British nationals meaning that the business will struggle to attract staff if immigration controls are implemented. Farmers warned this week that the price of British strawberries could jump by as much as 50 per cent if the industry loses its Romanian and Bulgarian seasonal workers.

"Arconic knowingly supplied flammable panels for use in tower: emails","By Tom Bergin | LONDON LONDON Six emails sent by and to an Arconic Inc (ARNC.N) sales manager raise questions about why the company supplied combustible cladding to a distributor for use at Grenfell Tower, despite publicly warning such panels were a fire risk for tall buildings. The emails, dating from 2014 and seen by Reuters, were between Deborah French, Arconic's UK sales manager, and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for the refurbishment contract at Grenfell Tower in London, where 79 people died in a blaze last week. When asked about the emails, Arconic said in a statement that it had known the panels would be used at Grenfell Tower but that it was not its role to decide what was or was not compliant with local building regulations. The company manufactures three main types of Reynobond panel-- one with a polyethylene (PE) core, one with a fire retardant core and another with a non-combustible core, according to its website. Diagrams in a 2016 Arconic brochure for its Reynobond panels describe how PE core panels are suitable up to 10 meters in height. Panels with a fire resistant core -- the FR model -- can be used up to 30 meters, while above that height, panels with the non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used, the brochure says. Grenfell Tower is more than 60 meters tall. The brochure also issued a blunt warning that cladding can be a fire risk. "When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly," the brochure said. "As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material." Nonetheless, between May and July 2014, French, who was based at Arconic's factory in Merxheim, France, responded to requests from the companies involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower on the availability of samples of five different types of Reynobond aluminum-covered panels, all of which were only available in the combustible PE and FR versions, according to Arconic brochures. In the end, Arconic said on Friday, the company provided PE panels. "While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts," the company said in an emailed statement in response to the Reuters enquiry. "The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire are devastating, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragedy ... We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy," the statement said. French did not respond to requests for comment. Arconic, which was known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, declined to say if it knew how tall the tower was and the emails seen by Reuters do not specifically refer to its height. They do, however, refer to "Grenfell Tower" and mention other high rise projects where paneling has been used when discussing the appearance that was being sought for Grenfell Tower. Arconic also knew the quantity of panels being supplied and thus the total exterior coverage. A source at one of the companies involved in the process said Arconic had "full involvement" throughout the contract bidding process. Omnis Exteriors, which cut the Arconic tiles to shape and supplied them to the cladding contractor, said it was not responsible for the choice of panel. "CEP played no part in the selection of Reynobond PE and simply fulfilled the order as directed by the design and build team," the company said in a statement on Saturday, referring to CEP Architectural Facades Ltd, the Omnis unit which fulfilled the contract. Harley Facades Ltd., the company which installed the panels, Rydon Group, the overall contractor on the 2014-2016 Grenfell refurbishment, and the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns the tower block all declined to comment. Rydon previously said in a statement that its work on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was intended to give the building better heat and sound insulation, complied with all building regulations. Harley said last week it was "not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower". In the emails, French and representatives of Harley and Rydon also discuss the choice of panel models and colors and how they were inching towards securing the contract with the local authority. Harris did not respond to requests for comment. On Sunday, British finance minister Philip Hammond said the type of panels used, which are cheaper than non-combustible panels, were banned for use in high rise buildings in Britain, as they are in Europe and the United States. Omnis said combustible Reynobond PE material was safe to use on high rise buildings if the insulation material usually put behind the panels was made of incombustible material such as mineral fiber. Some safety experts say the regulations are not black and white. The UK uses a 'principles-based' approach to regulation which puts an onus on companies to operate safely, based on common understanding of risks and the technology available. This differs to the highly specific 'rules-based' approach to regulation taken in the United States. Supporters of the principles-based approach say it avoids the emergence of loopholes and means companies have to take account of new information on risks immediately, rather than wait for a new regulation to be drafted. The fatal fire was started by a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer in one of the apartments, London police said on Friday. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said insulation on the building, and the cladding panels, had failed safety tests carried out after the disaster. The police investigation was considering the possibility of manslaughter and criminal offences in respect of the fire.

"South Africa dramatically level T20 series with nail-biting three-run win over England at Taunton","Tom Curran’s stunning entrance onto the international stage and a welcome return to form for Jason Roy could not prevent England from a three-run defeat in this second T20 international against South Africa. Curran, the Surrey fast bowler who was born in Cape Town, took three for 33 on debut to help restrict South Africa to 174 for eight. That total had looked eminently gettable after another South-African-born Surrey player in Jason Roy returned to form with a blistering 67 during England’s chase. Read more Bairstow learning to accept not being an England regular Roy’s first half-century in 11 internationals was a decent response to being dropped for last week’s Champions trophy semi-final against Pakistan. But England’s chase nosedived after he was controversially dismissed for obstructing the field in the 16th over. It means this three-match series will now be settled in Cardiff on Sunday, where a victory will take Eoin Morgan’s side to No1 in the world in this format. This was England’s first match at Taunton since 1983 and the 12,500 sell-out crowd were expecting plenty of runs given this venue is home to the truest batting pitch in the country and had seen Somerset and Nottinghamshire recently score 834 between them in a 50-over match here. England had not played at Taunton since the early eighties (Getty) So it was no surprise Morgan, wanting to know what a good score here actually was, chose to bowl first after winning toss. England made three changes to the team that thrashed South Africa by nine wickets in the first match of this series in Southampton on Wednesday. That meant international debuts for Liam Livingstone, in for the rested Alex Hales, and Curran, replacing leg-spinner Mason Crane. Liam Plunkett also came in for Mark Wood, the Durham fast bowler rested ahead of the upcoming Test series against South Africa. Curran made an immediate impact for England (Getty) England got off to the perfect start thanks to Curran, who had an instant impact after coming on in the fourth over to bowl Reeza Hendricks with his second ball in international cricket to leave South Africa on 25 for one. With AB De Villiers, standing in as captain for the absent Faf Du Plessis in this series, dropping himself down the order, Mangaliso Mosehle was the next man in. The wicketkeeper had a brief but memorable stay at the crease, scoring 15 from 12 balls and using three bats before edging Plunkett behind. That dismissal in the eighth over, the tourists now 57 for two, brought De Villiers to the crease. De Villiers stood in as captain for South Africa (Getty) But he had lost two partners by the time he had got his eye in. The first was JJ Smuts, bowled by the first ball of the match in Southampton, smashing 45 from 35 deliveries here before top-edging a full toss from spinner Liam Dawson to square leg. David Miller then feathered Plunkett behind as South Africa slipped to 113 for four in the 14th over. De Villiers had made a relatively pedestrian half-century in Southampton. However, he was back to his dynamic best here, racing to 46 from 19 balls after sweeping David Willey out of the ground and into the neighbouring River Tone in the 15th over. He top-edged the very next ball, though, to fall short of another fifty, his team now 127 for five. The skipper eventually fell for 46 (Getty) England dropped three catches before Curran stole the show with two more wickets in the penultimate over of the innings. Chris Morris, dropped twice off Jordan the previous over, was finally caught by Jason Roy in the deep. Curran then bowled Andile Phehlukwayo to cap a memorable debut as South Africa were pegged back to 174 for eight by the end of their 20 overs. England lost Sam Billings, opening in place of Hales, in the second over of their reply, the Kent player caught close in after failing to get hold of Morris. But Roy and Jonny Bairstow were both in brilliant touch as they kept the run chase motoring along, guiding the hosts to 92 for one at the halfway stage of the innings. Bairstow was in good form once again (Getty) Bairstow had made an unbeaten half-century on Wednesday but he fell for 47 this time after hitting Morris straight to mid-on. Roy’s contentious dismissal – after he was deemed to have deliberately moved into the path of the ball to stop a run out – left England 133 for three one ball into the 16th over. By the end of it, they needed 40 to win from the final 24 deliveries. England fell just short in the end (Getty) That equation became 25 from 14 after Taunton-born Jos Buttler was bowled by Phehlukwayo. By the time Morgan was dismissed by Dane Paterson England were left needing 11 to win from Phehlukwayo’s final over and, after Livingstone was run out, four from the final ball. But Dawson was unable to connect as England fell agonisingly short.  More about: Twenty20 England cricket South Africa cricket Reuse content",http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/south-africa-beat-england-twenty20-series-three-run-win-a7805811.html,2017-06-22
"Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind review: The Force Awakens of gaming","With Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind, the first additional 'Chapter' to the MMO (read: expansion), Bethesda seems to have taken a sly tip from Hollywood. This is essentially The Force Awakens of the gaming world: a nostalgic draw that's broad enough in its appeal to satiate newcomers.  We zoom back 700 years before the events of 2002's The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind here, and those subtle differences and shifts in time are obvious in-game. Settlements are (conveniently) smaller; a few of the cities you may remember don't even exist yet, but are hinted at. You may find a page detailing Vivec's desire to build Ebonheart anew on the island, a quest spills the first inkling of what an Ashlander settlement named Ald'ruhn would later become, and even the capital Vivec City is still largely a construction site. Read more Prey review: Discovering the familiar That said, ESO: Morrowind still feels familiar, and that's where its greatest flaw arises. For hard-core players of the 2002 game, for anyone who wrung that map out for every possible quest, every nook and cranny, they may return to this world with a lessened sense of awe. There's little to surprise here, and since MMOs demand certain constrictions, it can feel limiting when each landmark only really offers a single quest to players.  However, best judgement would state those feelings are rather unfair, even if they're entirely natural and uncontrollable. This isn't the same game. And, if you're approaching ESO: Morrowind as, essentially, a condensed remaster of a classic game through the lens of an MMO, it's overwhelmingly effective.  The scale may not match Skyrim's epic vistas, but there's been an incredible amount of detail added to this world, which is wonderful for veteran players to witness. The intricate ceiling paintings within Vivec City, for example, or the way there's a luminous red, organic carpet that seems to line the floors of the Kwama Egg mines. Any illusion this is a straight remaster, of course, dissipates the second you find yourself in a crowd of other players. It's particularly strange when NPCs are always asking how on earth you managed to find their hideouts, or with what bravery you must have ventured into these abandoned dungeons, when these locations are often as busy and filled with brawling as a bar at happy hour. Maybe that's just the price you pay for Bethesda sticking to their guns and ensuring ESO feels as authentically like the rest of the franchise as possible, with previous games' superior sense of writing certainly not lost in the transition. There are the same memorable characters (from Sun-in-Shadow, the slave you help free from Telvanni bigotry, or the Ashlander Seryn and her noble quest to stop her power-mad brother), and that trademark sense of humour remains intact, with one quest even boldly dropping a Ghostbusters reference without even a flinch.  Furthermore, Morrowind feels surprisingly like its own entity. Of course, you need ESO as a base game first, but you could very well play Morrowind in its entirety without ever feeling the draw to step on the mainland.  A feeling only amplified by the fact it comes with a unique introduction for new characters, thrusting you straight back into Seyda Neen after your initial escape from slavers, all with the help of a fan-favourite assassin.  Add to that some of the new features offered here; there's last year's One Tamriel level-balancing update, for example, which removes all previous limitations when it comes to quests or group gameplay, meaning low-level and high-level players can all happily work together and no part of Morrowind will be initially out of bounds for newcomers.  The new Warden class also offers a brand new approach to skill trees that's a lot more balanced than previous offerings, combining Animal Companion conjuration (including an ultimate that gives you a little bear friend to help out in battle, always useful), Green Balance healing powers, and Winter's Embrace destructive magic. All especially useful in dungeon gameplay, since a Warden can perform pretty well across all different roles.  Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind is by no means game-changing. Yet, in that perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation, there's pure joy to be found within.

"SEPTA approves express bus for Roosevelt Boulevard","SEPTA approved a long-awaited express route on Roosevelt Boulevard on Thursday, a first step in Philadelphia’s plan to improve safety on that busy, and dangerous, thruway. “We are committed to finding short- and long-term solutions to improve the safety of all of those who travel on the boulevard,” said Michael Carroll, the city’s deputy managing director for transportation and infrastructure systems. “We believe this express bus service will be a vital step toward that goal.” The Roosevelt Boulevard bus on the 10-mile route between Frankford Transportation Center and  Neshaminy Mall promises to be 30 percent faster than the 45 minutes it takes the existing Route 14 bus, SEPTA officials have said. It should attract 2,500 new riders each workday, many of them people now driving cars. Between 2011 and 2016, 50 people died on the road, 20 of them pedestrians. New bus shelters are planned for stops at Cottman Avenue, Rhawn Street, Welsh Road, Grant Avenue, Red Lion Road, and the Neshaminy Interplex, officials said, the busiest stops on the 14 bus. The cost of the express line is $2 million, with a grant for $1.9 million paying for the new shelters. During the monthly board meeting, the transportation authority’s board also approved a route change to the 132 bus to provide more service on Route 113 and Bensalem Pike in Bucks County. An expansion to the 49 bus, which would run between Fairmount Park and Grays Ferry, will be considered at a meeting later this summer after SEPTA reviews feedback from the public and City Council members. SEPTA’s board also granted easements to Sunoco Pipeline LP for a natural gas liquids pipeline along its rail routes. Sunoco is building the pipeline from Ohio to the company’s Marcus Hook facility along the Delaware River and sought four easements to cross SEPTA’s rights of way for transmission lines and unused rails in Aston Township, Chester Township, and Brookhaven Borough, in Delaware County, for two 16-inch pipelines and two 20-inch pipelines. Sunoco would pay $1.6 million for a 29-year, five-month lease, according to SEPTA’s meeting agenda. The easements are part of a 350-mile, $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 line, now under construction in Western Pennsylvania and coming east after approvals from state regulators earlier this year. The first of two pipelines, it is slated for completion by September and will move natural gas liquids such as propane, ethane, and butane. Those with concerns about the environmental impact of fracking and natural gas liquids spoke against the easements Thursday. Ann Dixon, of West Philadelphia, described shrinking coastlines in Louisiana and temperatures so high in Phoenix that planes can’t take off, and she blamed the use of fossil fuels. Her remarks were punctuated with profanity, and Dixon said she cursed to make a point. “The least we can do is when people can make these decisions that are going to negatively influence our lives is to make them a little bit uncomfortable,” said Dixon, a member of the environmental activism group 350 Philadelphia. Members also expressed concern about leaks or an explosion of the flammable fluids. The pipeline would cross 50 to 150 feet beneath SEPTA rights of way. “We meet and exceed all regulations, and the safety of this project has already been evaluated and confirmed,” said Jeff Shields, a spokesman for Sunoco Pipeline.

"Trump reaches out to lawmakers on healthcare as another says 'no'","By Jeff Mason and Yasmeen Abutaleb | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON President Donald Trump made calls to fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Friday to mobilize support for their party's healthcare overhaul while acknowledging the legislation is on a "very, very narrow path" to passage. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill. "We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns," White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form. "This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer," Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. That could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. FOUR CONSERVATIVES OPPOSE BILL On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers "four very good people." "It's not that they're opposed," he said. "They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that." Trump said getting approval would require traveling a "very, very narrow path" but that "I think we're going to get there." "It's going to be a good bill," Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday. For the House of Representatives' version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders. Trump later criticized the House bill privately as "mean" and this week called for a health plan "with heart." He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.

"The Millennium series is a 'franchise' – a drive-through book, with extra fries","It’s top secret and hush hush and is strictly embargoed until 7 September when it’s published. But I was privileged to see some of the fifth volume of the Millennium trilogy even as it was being written. I promise not to give too much away, but consider this a sneak preview, or trailer for The Girl Who Takes An Eye For An Eye. If you want to know what happens to ace Swedish ass-kicker and hacker extraordinaire Lisbeth Salander and heroic journalist Mikael Blomkvist, you’re in the right place. It’s written by David Lagercrantz, who took over the reins from Stieg Larsson for the last one, The Girl In the Spider’s Web. You may recall that Larsson, having written all three of the trilogy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest, and had them accepted for publication, promptly dropped dead. Late for a meeting, he ran up a few flights of stairs when the lift broke down, and collapsed with a heart attack, aged 50. The poignant back-story helped the books sell millions worldwide, but the death of the author meant it was inevitable that someone would have to pick up the baton and carry on. The job went to Lagercrantz, a Swedish writer then best known for ghosting the quasi-autobiography of the Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, I Am Zlatan.  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was released in 2011, seven years after the death of the novel's author Stieg Larsson (Rex) I met him in Stockholm not long after the release of the Spider’s Web. We were having dinner at this little restaurant attached to the Royal Opera House. Which is when Lagercrantz came out with a question still ringing in my ears. The question was this: “What are we supposed to do with all the money?” And that was before he cracked the film deal. It’s not a question you get to hear all that often. Except possibly in bank-heist movies. Nobody had robbed a bank, but Lagercrantz felt as though he had. He felt bad about being such a huge success. (The Spider’s Web book has now sold more than million copies worldwide, including 550,000 in the UK.) It’s probably unfair to refer to the Millennium series as a “franchise”. It makes you think of McDonalds – a drive-through book, with extra fries. But that is the word used in the industry. There is the James Bond franchise and the Jason Bourne franchise, and now the Hercule Poirot franchise too. Robert Ludlum died in 2001 and has since written 10 books. Some say they’re actually better now, posthumously. The point is, the writer has to, if not exactly imitate the original, at least borrow the characters invented by, as it may be, Ian Fleming or Robert Ludlum or Agatha Christie, and channel some of the spirit and possibly style of the original. But for some writers it feels like a hand-me-down. “Can she (Lisbeth Salander) be cloned like Dolly the Sheep?” asked one sceptical New York author and editor, Jeanne McCulloch. “No, I don’t think so.” I know of one writer who has partnered up with Wilbur Smith, the bestselling South African novelist. If you look carefully at the poster – and the cover – of his last book, Predator (“Revenge is not enough”) you will see the name of “Tom Cain” in smaller print (real name David Thomas). But Wilbur Smith is now 80-something and is slowing down and partnering up. James Patterson has done something similar. Only more so. I’m not quite sure if he does any writing these days. He just has a business model. And a host of sidekicks doing most of the work for him. It’s the only way he can publish so many books under his name. So far this year, the world has seen the publication of 16 Pattersons. The name still sells even though it no longer corresponds to an individual but rather an assembly line. Kingsley Amis in the past (Colonel Sun) and, more recently, Anthony Horowitz in Trigger Mortis, have done a fine job of re-imagining James Bond for a new audience. Horowitz riffed on some actual lines of Fleming’s that he had dug up. I can think of one writer who turned down the Bond franchise, not just once but twice, and who happened to be at the dinner with Lagercrantz – writer Lee Child. He thinks Bond can’t be done now, because Bond was specific to an era, and that the figure of Bond was, in part, responsible for changing the landscape. Also they were never going to pay him enough (they offered him less than 50 per cent; if he writes a Reacher, it’s 100 per cent, so why would he bother?).  Wilbur Smith has sold more than 120 million copies of his novels. Now in his eighties, Smith continues to write with the help of Tom Cain (AKA David Thomas) (Rex) Just to get the scene above clear: Lagercrantz was asking Child the question about the money, not me. I was thinking, booze, women and fast cars, and the rest I’d squander. Child recommended a few good causes, with the emphasis on education. So I am not at all surprised to learn that the author of An Eye For an Eye will be “donating proceeds” from the book to Läsrörelsen, a charity that encourages young people to become readers. The reason I mention Child is because this is a writer who is fully invested in his own books. Jack Reacher, his hero, is also his alter ego. The muscular, economical style of his books (“verbal pointillism” as Lagrercrantz and David Thomas call it) is entirely his own. And he has no difficulty with being successful. He says literature is on a par with football, film, and PlayStation games. It’s part of the entertainment industry and has to be able to hold its own with any of them. He doesn’t think it’s intrinsically better for you to read a book than to go and watch a movie, it’s just different. He says of his own work, “It’s 100 per cent commercial, and it’s 100 per cent art. There is no conflict.” Although generous towards other writers, he tends to be derisive of a certain literary self-consciousness which he sums up in the phrase, “Hey, Ma, look I’m writing!”  He also made a mildly quizzical remark about the Lagercrantz novel, The Girl in the Spider’s Web, in a review for the New York Times, which had come out shortly before. The fact is, he doesn’t want anyone else stealing his Reacher character, not before he’s dead anyway, so it was natural for him to doubt whether anyone could just turn up and resuscitate Salander and co. He invoked Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, in which pets and people never die, but aren’t fully alive either, and stumble around in a twilight zone like the mis-shapen zombies they are. He also made lots of rather favourable remarks too, but I suspect this was the one that stung. Lagercrantz was more than a little upset, he was fuming. And was refusing to read Child’s latest in protest. He was trying single-handedly to put a dent in his astronomical sales figures. Understandable, I would say, if a touch sensitive. I mean, it was on the front-page of the NYTimes book review pages, and was overall pretty decent. Most writers would be satisfied, I would say. But not Lagercrantz.  For one thing, he thought he had done a much better job than the review would suggest. And I agree with him. It was a first-class re-working of Larsson. Perhaps it was even better than Larsson. There is an idiot-savant kid in the story, and Salander becomes his guardian angel. For the first time, Lagercrantz had brought out the motherly side of a vengeful bisexual punk. Mission accomplished. Child is fully invested in his books. Jack Reacher, his hero, is also his alter ego (Rex) But the other thing is that Lagercrantz has doubts about what he is doing. Child sometimes refers to himself as “the Reacher guy”. I don’t think Lagercrantz would refer to himself as “the Salander guy” or “the Blomkvist guy”. The two of them met at a conference (Ghosts) at the Stockholm Business School. And I had the chance to put to them the question most readers will surely be asking themselves: “In the event of a final showdown between Salander (slim and wiry and tricky) and Reacher (immense and extremely direct), who would win?” Child snorted at the very idea and thought it was an obvious walkover for Reacher; Lagercrantz suggested that they would see that they were basically on the same side and would walk off into Nordic noir-land and have a coffee together. I like that. Largercrantz’s problem is that he had a literary scholar father who thought that unless you were Tolstoy or James Joyce then you were just producing pointless garbage. As a result, Lagercrantz really dreams of writing the perfect “literary” novel, a new Anna Karenina, not another Salander. He feels as if, right now, he is slumming it. He subscribes to a feudal model of literature: grands seigneurs sitting at the high table, with the plebs sweeping up after them. Maybe it was because he was annoyed with Child that he invited me over to his apartment in Södermalm (very Blomkvist) to watch him write. He was in the middle of writing the book that you will soon have in your hands, The Girl Who Took an Eye for an Eye. Lagercrantz writes on a dedicated computer that is disconnected from the grid. He fears the activities of real Salander types hacking into the next novel and revealing all. At night he locks it up in a safe just in case. But since he kindly let me look over his shoulder while he was working, I sort of know what happens.  ‘Largercrantz’s problem is that he had a literary scholar father who thought that unless you were Tolstoy or James Joyce then you were just producing pointless garbage’ (Getty) I think I recognised two words: one was “Mikael” and the other one was “kaffe”. So I know that Blomkvist drinks a fair amount of coffee in this one. We did discuss the Camus novel, The Outsider, and there is more than a hint of that book in this one, with Lisbeth Salander being locked up in prison and yet, together with Blomkvist, on the outside and her own unstoppable hacking skills, tackling some fundamental injustice in Swedish society.  While I was there a guy rang the doorbell and asked to come up and talk about doing the Millennium series and learn from Lagercrantz how it was done. I’m calling that respect from fellow Swedes. David Thomas, who writes with Wilbur Smith, suggested (in an email) that, in the current literary critical parlance (he actually used the word “bollocks”), “Shakespeare, Dickens, Balzac, Jane Austen, Victor Hugo, etc, etc  would all now be dismissed as genre fiction writers. And Shakespeare and Dickens, in particular, wrote specifically to grab an audience for commercial gain.” And some of Shakespeare may well have been written by someone other than Shakespeare too.  Popular is often popular because it’s good. It may even be great. Who knows? As someone may have said about the French Revolution, it’s too soon to judge. Let Tolstoy do what Tolstoy does and let Lagercrantz do what Lagercrantz does. There is no conflict. There is no reason why they can’t stroll off into the Stockholm sunset and have a coffee together. ‘The Girl Who Takes an Eye For an Eye’, by David Lagercrantz, translated from the Swedish by George Goulding, is published in the UK by MacLehose Press on 7 September.

"Shares in Chinese companies plunge as regulator warns of 'systemic risks' to biggest banks","Some of China’s largest companies may pose a systemic risk to the country’s banks, a senior banking official said on Thursday, in the latest signal that Beijing is ratcheting up scrutiny of a financial system plagued with hidden debt that poses a hazard to the health of the economy. The official, Liu Zhiqing of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, did not name any companies. But shares of some of China’s biggest global deal-makers plunged on Thursday. They included the publicly traded arms of Fosun International, which in recent years bought the Club Med chain of resorts and other properties; Dalian Wanda, which owns the AMC Theaters chain in the US and has long sought deals in Hollywood; and the HNA Group, an acquisitive conglomerate with murky ownership. At a briefing on Thursday in Beijing, Mr Liu, deputy head of the commission’s prudential regulation bureau, said that his agency was looking into “systemic risk of some large enterprises,” according to numerous media accounts, and that the risk could spread to other institutions. Read more China sees surprise boost to exports but concerns remain over economy Later on Thursday, Li Xinghao, a spokesman for the banking commission, said Mr Liu had been “misquoted” as saying that the commission was worried about the risk posed by those companies. Still, his comments come as China clamps down on some of its most ambitious and acquisitive companies. Last week, people familiar with the matter said that Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of the Anbang Insurance Group, had been detained for undisclosed reasons. Anbang, which rose to prominence in recent years for big deals including its purchase of New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, had been under official pressure over how it raises money. China has been trying to get its unruly financial sector under control, worried that asset bubbles and its enormous unofficial — or “shadow” — banking system could threaten its economy, the world’s second largest after the US’s. In April, President Xi Jinping urged the country to ward off systemic risks to maintain financial security during a group study session for members of the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party. Read more China economy beats expectations to grow 6.7% China’s economy hit by Donald Trump's unpredictable policy comments Workers of the ‘world’s factory’ rail against wage cuts and layoffs A surge in acquisitions by large Chinese companies in recent years has heightened worries that several of them, which rely on borrowed money for their large purchases, could pose a risk to the banks that lend to them. A crucial cause for concern is that many of these companies overpaid for some of these purchases. Analysts have expressed concern about the rapid expansion of China’s credit, warning that the country could face serious risk if it does not toughen measures to control its debt-fuelled binge. The authorities have also been increasingly nervous about the flow of money out of the country, which contributed to a sharp fall in the country’s foreign exchange reserves in recent years, before steadying in recent months. The increased scrutiny comes at a time of emphasis on political and economic stability ahead of the Communist Party’s 19th Party Congress this autumn, when leadership decisions are likely to be made.

"Dan Evans tests positive for cocaine: British No 3 announces he failed a drugs test in April","British tennis player Dan Evans has announced that he failed a drug test in April, testing positive for cocaine. The world No 50 claimed on Friday that he had taken the recreational drug out-of-competition for reasons "completely unrelated to tennis". He called a last-minute press conference at a hotel close to Queen's Club to announce that he had failed a drugs test. Earlier this week he received a wildcard to play at the Aegon Championships but had to withdraw because of injury. The fact that his use of the drug was entirely recreational means he will likely escape the maximum sentence of four-years for a positive test. In 2007, Martina Hingis served a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine, while in 2009 Richard Gasquet was banned for a year.  Evans is likely to be hit with a lengthy ban (Getty) “This is a very difficult day for me and I wanted to come here in person to tell you guys face to face," Evans said. “I was notified a few days ago that I failed a drugs test in April where I tested positive for cocaine. It's really important you know this was taken out-of-competition and the context was completely unrelated to tennis. “I made a mistake and I must face up to it. I do not condone for one second to anyone that this was acceptable behaviour. “I've let a lot of people down - my family, my coach, my team, sponsors, British tennis and my fans. “I can only deeply apologise from the bottom of my heart. This has been an extremely sad and humbling experience.” Evans failed the drugs test in April (Getty) The International Tennis Federation announced shortly after Evans made his statement that he provided a sample containing cocaine and its metabolite on April 24 2017. “In accordance with Article 2.1 of the TADP, Mr Evans was charged on 16 June with an Anti-Doping Rule Violation,” a statement published to the ITF’s website read. “Mr Evans has accepted the finding of cocaine in his sample collected on 24 April. “As positive tests for Non-Specified Substances carry a mandatory Provisional Suspension, Mr Evans will be provisionally suspended with effect from 26 June, under Article 8.3.1(c) of the 2017 TADP, pending determination of the case.” Evans was part of the team that won the Davis Cup in 2015 (Getty) The 27-year-old won the Davis Cup with Great Britain in 2015 and reached the fourth round of this year's Australian Open, his best ever result at a Grand Slam. Evans last played on 10 June at Surbiton, retiring with a calf injury before withdrawing from events in Nottingham, London and Eastbourne. Evans started 2017 in promising form (Getty) The British No 3 was dubbed 'the bad boy of British tennis' by the media early into his career.  He twice lost his LTA funding because of his poor off-court behaviour and an alleged lack of commitment. His first offence was in 2008 when he was spotted out in a nightclub the evening before a junior match at Wimbledon. However, he had worked hard to improve his image under the tutelage of his new coach, Mark Hilton, and enjoyed the best season of his career in 2016. He reached the Third Round at Wimbledon before repeating that performance at the US Open, where he held a match-point in the fourth set against three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka.

"Prince Harry needs to give up his right to the throne, right now he sounds like a reality TV star","For any child, losing your mother is a terrible, life-changing event, but almost 20 years after the death of Princess Diana, it’s time for her youngest son to move on and stop revisiting the past. With the publication of a revised edition of Andrew Morton’s book Diana – subtitled “in her own words” – previously inaudible sections of her original interview tapes have been enhanced to reveal the full extent of her fragile mental state, her eating disorders and suicide attempts. Having met Diana a few times, I can attest to her striking looks and charisma, but this woman was deeply unstable, manipulative and incapable of restraint. She couldn’t decide whether to woo the cameras or shun them, to speak to the press or to give them one her ‘tragic’ looks. As Andrew Morton’s book confirms, Diana could be as petty as Charles and equally determined to seek revenge for a huge list of grievances. Diana was a terrific fundraiser and champion for social justice, but would have been a disastrous Queen. Harry seems to have inherited some of his mother’s insecurities. Recently, he and his brother headed a high-profile campaign to remove the stigma from mental health issues, appearing on radio and television, talking about their own experiences. Whilst Harry is to be congratulated on speaking out about depression, his latest interview with Newsweek reeks of self-pity. In short, it’s a whinge that doesn’t play well when our daily news is dominated by the horrific plight of thousands of council tenants who have just discovered they are living in potentially unsafe tower blocks. Imagine waking up every day, knowing your home is made from the same material that’s just killed dozens of people. Unlike Harry, we don’t go about surrounded by bodyguards – imagine walking down the street to pray or go for a beer with friends and having someone mow you down in cold blood, screaming vile abuse. Those are ghastly problems none of us expected to have to deal with a few months ago. And yet this multimillionaire, privately educated, 30-something wants us to feel sorry for him? Prince Harry sought counselling after death of Princess Diana led to 'total chaos' Everyone who meets Harry says he is decent and likeable, coming across as a caring modern man with a sense of humour. Unlike a traditional Royal (and many older people), he is following the current trend for publicly sharing his emotions and his anxieties (but not the details of his love life) just like the stars of reality television do every day of the week. In the modern world, everyone is on their own special journey through life – I just wish we didn’t have to hear all the details of their inner turmoil – and the same applies to Harry. Ok, he had to walk behind his mother’s coffin, but what about the hundreds of victims of the IRA bomb attacks? One cannot imagine how difficult it must be to carry on living in the same town or neighbourhood knowing that some of the people responsible are still walking free. These days more men talk about their emotions in a way that was unthinkable a decade ago – Rio Ferdinand was the subject of a moving documentary about his struggle to bring up his family after the death of his wife from cancer. Blokes who once cultivated a tough persona (like Professor Green) have broken the taboo surrounding suicidal thoughts and depression. Jeff Brazier, a former reality star and a father to Jade Goody’s kids, has become a grief counsellor. I applaud them all. But now it’s time for Prince Harry to stop asking for our understanding about his situation. After a fairly useless time at school, including controversy about his exam results, he had an interesting army career. Now, however, he spends his time dashing around the world supporting his many charity projects – at 32, he needs a proper focus in life. As for the future, blabbing that “no one in the Royal family really wants to be King or Queen” is a disaster. Harry is a decent bloke, but he seems to be arguing for monarchy ‘lite’, with claims that the monarchy being “modernised” in a vague, undefined way. To survive, it should be slimmed down, and fit for purpose. Costs need to be slashed and the payroll hacked in half. The monarch is a national figure-head (exemplified by the Queen) and should be silent and dignified. I didn’t notice The Duke of Edinburgh (96 years old) issuing a bulletin about his stay in hospital earlier this week. He and the Queen just get on with the job. Prince Charles is another person who could do more and say less. The rest of the Royals – including Harry – should renounce their titles and join the rest of us in the world of work.  More about: Prince Harry Mental Health Reuse content",http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/right-now-prince-harry-sounds-like-a-reality-tv-star-a7805051.html,2017-06-23 15:01:33
"UK centrists who want to emulate Emmanuel Macron do not have far to look","On a warm Saturday evening in King’s Cross, 30-year-old Alexandre Holroyd is distributing leaflets outside the train station. His campaign literature promises a stronger economy, better security and smart Brexit negotiations. In itself this is not unusual; political parties often target commuter hotspots to grant their pamphlets a wider audience. But Holroyd and the team do not belong to the Conservative Party, nor are they enduring Corbynites. They represent French President Emmanuel Macron’s political start-up: La République En Marche (LREM). For British politicians seeking to replicate Mr Macron’s middle-ground success, they need look no further than London, where En Marche UK was founded in September 2016 by Ygal El Harrar and the aforementioned Mr Holroyd. The UK branch of Mr Macron’s campaign targets France’s sizeable population here, with 250,000 French citizens living in London alone. They are an eclectic mix of students, blue-collar workers and managerial classes, some new arrivals while others have lived in Britain for decades. Despite these differences, there is one resounding similarity: a majority of them (51.12 per cent) voted for Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the presidential election on the 23 April. En Marche UK’s good news does not stop there: fully 96 per cent of UK-based French voters backed Macron in the second round of the presidential election two weeks later, with high turnouts in both rounds. Read more Emmanuel Macron heads for landslide victory in parliament The party's success can partially be attributed to its efficient volunteer-led organisation. With communications through encrypted networks, they successfully planned canvassing operations in French expat hubs like South Kensington and Golders Green, as well as catching potential supporters as they debarked from the Eurostar at St Pancras. Their online campaign was equally smooth: locally-targeted French content with English translations proved popular with French residents and English journos alike. Real life "meetups" and meetings culminated on 21 February in a successful visit from Emmanuel Macron himself, with over 5,000 people in attendance. After the election of President Macron, En Marche UK is continuing its work for the French parliamentary elections. Mr Holroyd who has been selected by LREM as the parliamentary candidate to represent French citizens in the "Northern Europe" constituency including the UK. Holroyd is among the 52 per cent of Macron’s candidates who have never been involved in politics before. He declares at his meetings that he was “heartbroken” by Brexit and decided to enter French politics the day after the referendum. While he is clear that his job is not to interfere in British domestic politics, he affirms his commitment to the European project and further integration. His experience working as a regulatory specialist at FTI consulting in London, and previously in Brussels, leads him to support the creation of an EU finance minister and budget.

The incumbent MP is Socialist Axelle Lemaire, a popular former minister in the Hollande government. Moreover, barely a quarter of registered voters made it to the polls in 2015, meaning a lesser number of dedicated supporters could swing it any which way. But France’s expatriate population is exceptional: it experiences more deeply than others the new political divide of open and closed, and has proven receptive to Macron’s message of liberal globalisation. The future is never certain, but LREM momentum looks poised to leave its mark on Britain.

"Hundreds of English rivers drained below sustainable levels despite looming drought crisis","Nearly a quarter of all the rivers in England are at risk because of the vast amounts of water being removed for use by farms, businesses and people homes, according to a new report. Environment Agency figures obtained under freedom of information law by conservation charity WWF showed that 14 per cent of rivers were classed as over-abstracted – “meaning water removed is causing river to drop below levels required to sustain wildlife”. And a further nine per cent were described as “over-licensed”, meaning the river would fall to a similar low if permits to take water were utilised fully. Read more Gardeners warned of plant-killing drought after 10-month arid spell Tesco fined £8m for polluting river with thousands of litres of petrol Thames Water fined £20.3m for polluting the River Thames with sewage New Zealand river first in world to be given legal status of a person A number of rivers, including the River Chess in Hertfordshire and the River Colne in London, have already “dried up in some places with potentially devastating efforts on wildlife”, WWF said. The group warned Britain had experienced its driest winter and early spring in 20 years and was now in a “particularly perilous” situation with the prospect of further dry weather during the summer. Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF, said: “The south-east of England received less rainfall over the winter than Menorca.  “If we have a dry summer, our green and pleasant land could become as parched as some of the Mediterranean.  “This may sound attractive for sun seekers, but in fact it would be disastrous for wildlife. It would mean hundreds of millions of pounds of damage, tens of thousands of fish dying, and serious declines of some of our most loved wetland species.” The River Chess in Hertfordshire looks more like a path (Charles Rangeley) She said this fate could be avoided if the way the country’s “limited water supplies” were managed. “We have already seen the impacts of a drought in some place with rivers drying up or running low,” Ms Steele said. “As we witness the effects of climate change on our weather, temporary actions simply won’t do. “The UK Government must urgently set out an ambitious long-term plan for the environment, including new policies to manage our water resources, a plan to meet our climate change targets and proposals to tackle the illegal wildlife trade and protect our seas.” Read more Drought fears grow as wettest part of UK remains 'bone dry' In a report called Water for Wildlife: Tackling Drought and Unsustainable Abstraction, WWF pointed out that freshwater species had declined globally by 81 per cent since 1970 – “faster than in any other species group”. “Nature and wildlife are losing out in the rush to exploit the planet’s water resources. In England and Wales, fewer than one in five rivers are classed as in good ecological health,” the report said. “Nearly a quarter of rivers in England are at risk from unsustainable water abstraction, with water taken for use in homes, businesses and farms without enough left in rivers for wildlife to thrive. With the pressures of climate change and population growth, action is urgently needed.” It urged the Government to bring forward a promised Water Bill for England and Wales and take “urgent action in the 555 river water bodies where the environmental regulators indicate that abstraction is already damaging habitats and wildlife”. Abstraction licences should also ensure there was “sufficient water for wildlife in every river” and a national strategy to reduce water waste should be introduced, the report added. Peter King, a project officer from the Adur Rivers Trust, said that 20 years ago it was possible to swim in the Bevern stream. “Now you can literally walk across it all year round, as the water levels of the River Ouse have really gone down a lot,” he said.

As the water levels become less, the tourism becomes less, which is a real problem. Those who visit for canoeing, wildlife and fishing are not visiting anymore.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement that it recognised "the need to improve water management". "That is why we are committed to reforming abstraction licensing into a simplified, modern system that is fairer and more resilient," it said. "We are examining a range of ways to further protect the environment, including legislative or regulatory changes.” An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are in a prolonged period of dry weather which began in the autumn last year and despite rain in May some rivers, groundwaters and reservoirs are still lower than normal for the time of year.  “The Environment Agency is working actively with water companies, businesses and farmers to balance the needs of water users and minimise any potential impacts to people, the environment and wildlife. “Since 2008 we have made changes to over 250 abstraction licences to prevent over 27 billion litres of water per year being removed from the environment. “Our latest assessment (2016) shows that 81 per cent of rivers, lakes and estuaries have water flows that support the ecology well.” More about: rivers Environment Agency WWF Drought Reuse content",http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/england-drought-rivers-water-drained-removed-farms-homes-threat-farming-a7805156.html,2017-06-23
"National Audit Office slams Government’s ‘high cost and risky deal’ for Hinkley Point nuclear power station","The Government’s decision to commission a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point – which will receive an estimated subsidy of £30bn – has been condemned as a “high cost and risky deal” by the head of the National Audit Office (NAO). In a scathing report, the NAO said ministers had failed to look at alternative ways of funding the power station to get the best deal possible, saying officials expect it will add up to £15 to annual electricity bills up to 2030. The renewable energy industry accused the Government of “ignoring the most cost-effective forms of electricity generation” – onshore wind and solar. Greenpeace pointed out that this year’s school leavers would “still be paying for Hinkley when they approach their pension age, so it is concerning that the National Audit Office is suggesting it may not be worth their money”. Read more UN asks UK government to pause Hinkley nuclear reactor development Critics slam ‘out of date technology’ as Hinkley Point plan approved Hinkley could turn out to be an enormous white elephant Three out of four oppose Theresa May's Hinkley decision, poll reveals Construction of Hinkley Point C, which is being built in Somerset by French power firm EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group, has just begun amid concerns about whether the type of reactor to be installed will actually work. Similar projects in France, Finland and China have been “best by delays and cost overruns”, the report said, and there are “no examples of [the] reactor technology working anywhere in the world”. But, assuming such problems can be overcome and the two new reactors start generating, the NAO questioned whether it would prove to be a wise decision. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: “The Department [for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] has committed electricity consumers and taxpayers to a high cost and risky deal in a changing energy marketplace.  Read more Hinkley Point is a bad project. Now focus on making future renewable “Time will tell whether the deal represents value for money, but we cannot say the department has maximised the chances that it will be.” Under the deal, ministers agreed the plant would get a guaranteed price of £92.50 per megawatt-hour of electricity for 35 years. This means that if the market price falls below this level, energy-bill payers will be forced to make up the difference. The price of renewables, particularly solar and onshore wind, has fallen dramatically in recent years, and, at times, has turned energy prices negative.  In 2015, after an auction for the lowest guaranteed price, a solar power plant came in at £79.23 per megawatt-hour; onshore windfarms have achieved similar rates. Further reductions are expected; tycoon Sir Richard Branson has even predicted there will be “almost ... no energy costs at all” within a few decades. The rapidly decreasing price of renewables, coupled with the guaranteed price over such a long period, threatens to make the Hinkley deal even more expensive than the estimated subsidy of £30bn. Hinkley Point C: The numbers behind the new nuclear power station The NAO report criticised the chosen method of subsidising the £18bn plant, which could not have been built without some kind of support because of high upfront costs. “The department’s deal for Hinkley Point C has locked consumers into a risky and expensive project with uncertain strategic and economic benefits,” it said. “While committing the developer to bearing the construction risks means taxpayers and consumers are protected from costs over-running, consumers could end up paying more for Hinkley’s electricity than if the Government had shared these risks.” And the NAO warned that the taxpayer or energy consumer might end up footing the bill anyway if Hinkley hits major problems. “Past experience shows that ultimately these risks could shift back to taxpayers or consumers,” the report said. “If the project runs into trouble, the Government may need to fund alternatives to ensure secure supply, or come under pressure to renegotiate its deal. The department did not sufficiently appraise alternative ways to structure the deal.” Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, praised the NAO for highlighting “a number of factors that potentially made Hinkley Point C more expensive than it needed to be”. “The costs of renewables and smart power technology are changing much faster than the Government predicted, and what might have looked good value 10 years ago looks much less so now,” he said. “Arguably new nuclear build isn’t compatible with the Government’s smart grid ambitions, and the NAO is surely right to recommend reviewing the case for nuclear power once in every parliament.” Boris calls Hinkley 'a disgrace' And Nina Schrank, an energy campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the report was “a damning indictment” of the Government’s decision to go ahead with the deal. “It reveals that by the time the Government had signed off the deal, it was already a busted flush,” she said. “This year’s school leavers will still be paying for Hinkley when they approach their pension age, so it is concerning that the National Audit Office is suggesting it may not be worth their money.  “The Government didn’t even consider the impacts on bills beyond 2030. Their assumptions about the cost of renewables, especially offshore wind, were wildly inaccurate.  “Long before Hinkley is even finished, offshore wind will be producing far cheaper and safer power. The nuclear new-build programme should be halted for better alternatives that will meet our energy needs and provide jobs in the regions.” James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said the Government had spent 10 years pushing for Hinkley Point C to be built, stressing its “value for money”. But he said: “The Government has recently been ignoring the most cost-effective of all forms of electricity generation available right now – renewables.  “Solar and onshore wind are now cheaper than new gas and can be built quickly. New energy storage and flexibility technologies are rapidly developing and can be relied on to manage variability.  “Renewable energy and clean tech costs are rapidly falling. Renewables are now providing around a quarter of the UK’s power and have composed the overwhelming majority of new generation capacity installed in the past five years.” UK news in pictures 18 show all UK news in pictures 1/18 23 June 2017 British Prime Minister Theresa May addresses a news conference at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 23, 2017 Reuters 2/18 22 June 2017 Cosplay fans (L-R) George Massingham, Abbey Forbes and Karolina Goralik travel by tube dressed in Harry Potter themed costumes, after a visit to one the literary franchise's movie filming locations at Leadenhall Market in London, Britain Reuters 3/18 22 June 2017 Racegoers cheer on their horse on Ladies Day at the Royal Ascot horse racing meet, in Ascot, west of London Getty 4/18 21 June 2017 A reveller walks among the tipi tents at the Glastonbury Festival of Music and Performing Arts on Worthy Farm near the village of Pilton in Somerset, South West England Getty 5/18 20 June 2017 A police officer lays some flowers passed over by a member of the public, close to Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, after one man died and eight people were taken to hospital and a person arrested after a rental van struck pedestrian PA 6/18 The Borough Market bell is seen in Borough Market in central London following its re-opening after the June 3 terror attack Getty Images 7/18 Two women embrace in Borough Market, which officially re-opens today following the recent attack, in central London REUTERS/Hannah McKay 8/18 Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attends the re-opening of Borough market in central London following the June 3 terror attack Getty Images 9/18 People walk through Borough Market in central London following its re-opening after the June 3 terror attack Getty Images 10/18 News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch, with one of his daughters, visit Borough Market, which officially re-opened today following the recent attack REUTERS 11/18 A woman reacts in front of a wall of messages in Borough Market, which officially re-opened today following the recent attack, in central London REUTERS/Hannah Mckay 12/18 Vivenne Westwood walks the runway at the Vivenne Westwood show during the London Fashion Week Men's June 2017 collections Getty Images 13/18 Millwall fan and London Bridge hero Roy Larner on 'Good Morning Britain' Rex 14/18 Richard Arnold, Roy Larner, Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on 'Good Morning Britain' Rex 15/18 11 June 2017 England players celebrate after defeating Venezuela 1-0 to win the final of the FIFA U-20 World Cup Korea 2017 at Suwon World Cup Stadium in Suwon, South Korea AP 16/18 11 June 2017 England players celebrate with the trophy after the final match of the FIFA U-20 World Cup 2017 between Venezuela and England at Suwon World Cup Stadium in Suwon, South Korea EPA 17/18 11 June 2017 Great Britain's Alistair Brownlee celebrates winning the Elite Men Columbia Threadneedle World Triathlon Leeds Danny Lawson/PA Wire 18/18 11 June 2017 Two men drink beer outside the Southwark Tavern which reopened for business today next to an entrance to Borough Market which remains closed in London Getty Images EDF insisted the NAO report showed the power station “remains good value for consumers compared with alternative choices”.   “Consumers won’t pay a penny until the power station is operating and it is EDF Energy and CGN who will take the risk and responsibility of delivering it,” it said. “The project is having a major impact on the UK’s industrial capacity, jobs and skills.

"Brexit: Labour MPs back ex-Tory minister in key post to block arch-Leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg","Cross-party moves are afoot to ensure one of the most vocal opponents of hard Brexit is installed in a key position of influence in the House of Commons. Labour MPs have signalled they will back former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to be chair of the Treasury Select Committee, amid fears it could instead go to arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Independent revealed on Saturday how MPs from different parties are also threatening to join forces to defeat Theresa May's hard Brexit plans in Commons votes. Read more May under pressure to improve EU citizen's offer following Tusk critic The committee chair has a high-profile role scrutinising government economic strategy, with the ability to demand ministers give evidence in public hearings. Mr Rees-Mogg has signalled his intent to seek the post, saying that he would seek cross party consensus on key issues. But MPs opposed to hard Brexit fear his backing for Ms May's approach to leaving the EU will rob Parliament of a key avenue of scrutiny on withdrawal negotiations. One of the Treasury Committee's members in the last parliament, Wes Streeting, threw his weight behind Ms Morgan, telling The Guardian: "She has experience as a Treasury minister and cabinet minister and I trust her to hold the Government to account in an independent-minded way, following in the footsteps of [ex-chair] Andrew Tyrie. Jean-Claude Juncker says he has no clear idea of what the UK wants from Brexit "She is a waste sat on the backbenches if her talents won’t be put to use in government."

She said: "Clearly the major issue in the Parliament will be the Government’s Brexit negotiations. It will be the role of all backbench MPs to hold ministers to account on behalf of our constituents ... I believe I have shown over the past few months that I am a strong advocate for parliament being heavily involved in providing the necessary scrutiny and challenge to those important decisions." Another potential candidate for the job, which must go to a Tory MP, is the Wimbledon MP Stephen Hammond, who has also spoken out against hard Brexit.  Nicola Sturgeon: UK Government has no clear plan for Brexit negotiations Mr Rees-Mogg, who sat in the committee before it was dissolved for the election, has signalled that he is aware of concerns among Labour politicians. But he explained to the Financial Times: "The chairman of a select committee should balance his views against the views of the rest of the committee. Committees only work if members of it want to achieve a consensus report." The Independent revealed that MPs from different parties in the Commons are working together to form strategies to amend future legislation – including a key immigration bill – to force ministers to listen to business groups and to show the EU that Parliament wants a softer exit.

"The Perverse Presidency of Donald Trump","President Donald Trump speaks at Kirkwood Community College on June 21, 2017, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images I was mulling, as one does, over this presidency, and something crystallized in my head that I had not quite grasped before. Its policies are best described as simply perverse. The new Senate health-care bill is just the latest shining example. As Peter Suderman explains, it certainly isn’t based on any serious conservative ideas about reforming health care; it has no vision of how it wants health care to be organized; the loss of health care for the working poor will be most intense in Republican districts; and, just as important, a huge amount of it is simply kicked into the future — and could easily be forestalled or nullified by future Congresses and presidents. For good measure, by ending many of the taxes in the bill that make it work, and by removing the individual mandate, it risks sending the insurance markets into a deeper crisis. So what on earth is the point? For Trump, it seems to me, the whole point is to have a “win.” He doesn’t give a shit about what the bill actually contains. He’ll just lie about it afterward and assume his cult followers will believe him. For Ryan, it’s just a way to make a future tax cut for the superrich more budget-friendly, while pushing the political costs of shredding Medicaid onto some future sucker. And then you think about those tax cuts Ryan wants so badly. We are told that these cuts will spark so much growth they will pay for themselves — and more. And yet if there is one thing we really do know by now, it is that this strategy has spectacularly failed and failed again to work. Reagan’s tax cuts left the U.S. with an unprecedented peacetime deficit; George W. Bush inherited a small surplus and, after his tax cuts didn’t spur higher growth, handed Obama a Treasury close to bankrupt. In Kansas, the exact same strategy has incurred so much debt that a supermajority of the legislature, led by Republicans, have junked it. To pursue it a third time on a national scale is the definition of madness. The only theme I can infer is this: Whatever Obama did, Trump will try to undo. We are also living in an era of extreme inequality. Any responsible politician would be trying to find a way to ameliorate this, if for no other reason than it is deeply dangerous for the stability of our society and the health of our democracy. And yet the policy of the Republicans is to further increase such inequality to levels beyond even the robber-baron era. Again, the only word for this is … perverse. Ditto, for that matter, the idea that coal is the future of energy, and that climate change is a hoax. There was absolutely no point in withdrawing from the nonbinding Paris Accord — which is why Trump is now lying by claiming, as he did last Wednesday night, that it was binding. It was an utterly pointless way to isolate the U.S. from the rest of the world, and cede leadership to China. There was really no point at all in trashing the modest opening to Cuba under Obama, poisoning relations, and then just fiddling with the details. Elsewhere in foreign policy, we have just begun a deepening of the war in Afghanistan, the longest in American history, with no strategy in place. We’ve also junked the very careful limits that Obama put on the war against ISIS, leading to increasingly dangerous conflict with the Russians. And we now have a broader Middle East policy that has needlessly junked the core gain of the Obama years. The opening to Iran gave the U.S. far more leverage in the region, balancing out our previous Sunni commitments with a Shiite counterweight. Now Trump has fully committed the United States to one side of an intra-Muslim divide, while trashing Qatar, which houses the most important military base in the entire region. Again: perverse. And what on earth was the purpose of equivocating about the critical commitment to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, undermining the core underpinning of the Atlantic alliance — and then affirming it anyway? We haven’t even gotten commitments to more defense spending from the Europeans, apart from what Obama had managed to get them to agree to already. But what we have achieved is an unprecedented rupture in relations with most of the key European allies. It is also, frankly, perverse to ignore Russia’s blatant attempt to disrupt our elections and to keep reaching out to Putin — when the Congress will rightly deepen sanctions anyway, and Putin will pursue his own ambitions regardless. None of this is coherent strategy, and almost all of it counterproductive. The only theme I can infer is this: Whatever Obama did, Trump will try to undo. The perversity is the flip side of spite. Nathaniel Frank’s new book on the long fight for marriage equality, Awakening: How Gays And Lesbians Brought Marriage Equality to America, has one thing going for it: It’s a professional work of history. The only book on the movement we have so far wasn’t. Jo Becker’s hagiography of Chad Griffin, Forcing the Spring — my review is here — was an outright attack on everyone who had worked for the cause decades before Griffin tried to pass himself off as the gay Rosa Parks (yes, the book actually called him that). Awakening is therefore by default the best account we have, but it’s also a truly impressive, nuanced, fair account in its own right. It’s astonishing to me that the New York Times and the Washington Post have yet to review it. It relays the lung-filling highs and stomach-churning lows of the long trek toward gay dignity. Better still, it brings into focus the small band of disparate individuals who somehow brought what was unimaginable into reality. Many people think marriage was won overnight. This book proves it wasn’t. But its chief merit is that it explains for straight people and the younger gay and lesbian generations just how deeply divisive this issue was in the gay world for so long … all the way back to the 1950s, when the story really starts. The core gay divide in the gay world has always been between those who wanted equality and dignity in mainstream society and those who wanted to revolutionize and subvert the mainstream itself. Civil marriage was an issue where this divide was perhaps deepest. You can go back to the old gay magazine, One, published by the Mattachine Society, and see exactly the arguments that erupted later. In 1953, Frank notes, it ran an essay called “Homosexual Marriage?” The question mark was more like a gasp. In a screed against the normalization of gays, it worried that “equal rights means equal responsibilities. Equal freedoms means equal limitations.” A decade later, in 1963, a counterpoint appeared: “Let’s Push Homophile Marriage.” The term homophile itself was an attempt to redefine gay men as more than just sexual. The argument: “It seems to me that when society finally accepts homophiles as a valid minority with minority rights, it is going first of all to accept married homophiles. We are, after all, closest to their ideals.” In some ways, the gay-rights movement has spent the last few decades having that same fight over and over again. People celebrate outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on June 26, 2015 after its historic decision on gay marriage. Photo: Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images But it is, of course, more complicated and interesting than that. Marriage equality was both subversive and integrationist. It subverted nascent gay culture and traditional heterosexual assumptions. And yet it was also a uniquely powerful symbol of integration, equality, and a common humanity. It was based on a submerged reality, which was that many gay men and especially lesbians had always been in committed relationships — and that that experience was a vital bridge with heterosexuals, who usually comprised the rest of our families. The proof of that is in the number of gays and lesbians now in civil marriages: around a million. Nonetheless, for the longest time, the fight for marriage had almost no constituency in the post-1969 gay world — too conservative for some, way too utopian for others — and was kept aloft by a tiny group of activists, lawyers, and writers, who never gave up, despite setbacks at almost every turn. The biggest gay-rights group, the Human Rights Campaign, for example, remained hostile to pushing for marriage all the way through to the mid-aughts. The central figure from the get-go, Evan Wolfson, had to fight the rest of the movement continuously to keep the dream alive. It’s easy, in the wake of victory, to forget that story — but Frank covers its nuances better than anything else I’ve read. And he gives everyone their due. Toward the end of the book, he focuses a little too much on the litigation and not enough on the culture, but this is a small flaw in an otherwise indispensable account. What resolved the gay divide, in the end, was the religious right. When George W. Bush endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004, as Frank explains, almost everyone in the gay movement realized that something fundamental to our human dignity and civil rights was at stake. Old ideological divisions briefly evaporated in the heat of the struggle, and the fast-rising support for the idea among gays and lesbians themselves turned into a grassroots revolution. The long game eventually, cumulatively brought the breakthrough. What began as as light covering of snow, easily brushed away, became, snowflake by snowflake, a drift, which eventually precipitated an avalanche. We live in the wake of it. The other day, I managed to see the new documentary by David France, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson, at the Provincetown Film Festival. It shines a piercing light on another cleavage in the gay world. And that’s the long tension between gays and lesbians and transgender people. There’s an astonishing clip in the movie of a gay-rights rally for New York Pride in 1973, when a transgender instigator of Stonewall, Sylvia Rivera, forced herself onstage and grabbed the microphone. And as she began her impromptu speech, you can see and hear the crowd booing, shouting, and heckling at the interloper. It’s a riveting and horrifying moment. For all the high-flown talk about the “LGBT community,” the truth is, these three groups have often had little in common — apart from marginalization. Many gay men have sadly long been uncomfortable around transgender people; and many lesbians have bristled at times at the notion that transgender women are truly the same as women who have been physiologically such from birth. And then there was Marsha P. Johnson, an icon of Stonewall and the lost gay world of the West Village in the 1980s and early 1990s. I actually don’t know quite how to identify her. She dressed as a woman but also as a man. Her family refer to her in the film interchangeably as “he” and “she.” She floated through all these divisions and seemed to belong in every camp. Was she a drag queen? Or transgender? Or a cross-dresser? In the end, I think, her charisma transcended all these identities. She was an individual, and in some ways, a saint. Gentle, African-American, always beaming, bringing outcasts into her home, shimmering through Pride like a vision of divine love, she seemed to have no enemies in an often contentious community. And she died like a martyr, her body suddenly washing up at the Christopher Street piers in 1992, quickly designated a suicide, with only the most cursory of investigations. Marsha P. Johnson Photo: Netflix No one who knew her believed she killed herself. And the movie tries, all these years later, to solve the mystery of her death. Sadly, it doesn’t quite deliver the payoff you want, but you learn so much along the way it doesn’t really matter. As an evocation of a different era, the movie is quite wonderful. I have just two quibbles. There’s an implication that the Stonewall riots were instigated by trans people of color, who were then erased by the white cis middle class. This is far too pat. It’s critical that the key trans figures at Stonewall be recognized. Ditto gay men of color. Putting them front and center on that fateful night is vital for the historical record, and I’m glad this movie exists for that reason alone. But you only have to look at the actual photographs of the riots to see masses of young gay white men as well, lining up on the streets, jumping into the melee. And in some ways, it was the rebellion of those with much more to lose that marked a shift in consciousness. There’s also a statement in the movie that there was no gay-rights movement before Stonewall. This is just untrue, and it erases the legacy of the early gay rights pioneers in the 1950s, like Frank Kameny, Barbara Gittings, and Harry Hay, who founded the movement in the terrifying era of the lavender scare. People who risked their lives and careers marching in front of the White House in the 1950s, who started the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis, who laid the foundations for marriage equality, gays in the military, nondiscrimination in employment, and coined the term “Gay is Good,” deserve not to be forgotten. This movie wipes them from history. But there I go again, I suppose. It wouldn’t be a gay movie without an internal gay controversy. And the internecine fights will never fully end because the accident of homosexual orientation — more than any other —knows no single demographic, or gender, or race, or class. To form a coherent movement out of that massive, random diversity was never going to be easy. Pride Marches this year have been disrupted and halted by groups connected with Black Lives Matter who oppose the mainstream corporate support and openly gay police organizations that so many of us regard as huge achievements of integration, rather than blights. But purist factions have always tried to impose a singular vision on a very non-singular group of people. It has always been that way, from the very beginning. Love breaks through every human identity, and so must a movement rooted in the search for love. And of that divisiveness and contentiousness, spats and feuds, marches and countermarches, and rare, fleeting moments of unity, I am, in some, yes, perverse way, proud.

"Snowdonia rainwater used for hydro energy scheme","Image copyright Dave Roberts/Geograph Two communities in Wales will receive energy from a hydro scheme using rain water in Snowdonia. The water runs into the River Ogwen and the aim is to capture the power of its flow to produce electrical energy using hydro technology. It would provide power for Bethesda and Llanberis whose communities funded the £700,000 project through shares. Both schemes will be launched on Saturday. Keith Jones, environmental adviser for National Trust Wales, said a return on its investment was only one of the reasons for the communities getting involved in the hydro projects. "The main motivation was that the residents wanted to invest in their own area for future generations to have their own electricity supply", he added. "People from one of the poorest areas of western Europe wanted to control their own future and now they can. "They have locally-generated electricity from natural water in the mountains that surrounds their homes."",http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-40386070,1527-15-16

"Dutch terror threat remains ‘substantial’ despite recent wave of attacks","Photo: Depositphotos.com The terrorist threat risk in the Netherlands remains ‘substantial’ and will not be increased despite the attacks and attempted attacks in Europe over the past few months, the Dutch counter-terrorism unit NCTV said on Friday. The terror threat in the Netherlands is currently at level four, the second highest possible, and has been so for several years. This means that there is a real risk of an attack but no concrete indications that one is being planned. This year so far, 45 people have been killed in 10 jihad-motivated attacks in Europe. Four took place in France and three in the UK. The NCTV also said in its latest report that the majority of Dutch jihadis have not gone over to violence but that this may change if hardened fighters return from Syria and Iraq. Last year officials were aware of five returnees, this year just one so far. In total, 50 people have returned from abroad but most came back several years ago. Those considered dangerous are kept under supervision. Some 190 Dutch nationals are thought to be living in Iraq and Syria, a total which has remained stable for some time.

"Gas grab and global warming could wipe out Wadden Sea heritage site","The world’s largest unbroken intertidal system of sand and mud flats could sink beneath the waves by the end of the century due to sea level rise and subsidence caused by gas drills funded by Barclays and other international banks. The Unesco world heritage site at the Wadden Sea on the Dutch coast stretches over 10,000 sq km. Its saltmarshes, sandy shoals, dunes and mussel beds host millions of migratory birds every year, as well as thousands of basking seals. But the storm-weathered Frisian coastline may be living on borrowed time. One report this month predicted that it would be submerged by 2100 if current global warming trends and planned gas extractions continue. “It is more likely that the area will drown than that it will survive,” said Rolf Schuttenhelm, the paper’s author. “The equation is quite simple. If sea level rise and subsidence combined are larger than the maximum speed of sedimentation – and they are – then with time, the drowning of the tidal system becomes inevitable.” Geese, oystercatchers, spoonbills, pelicans and flamingoes would lose their havens if the flats disappeared. The loss would also sound a death knell for communities which have lived for millennia behind the dykes that dot the Friesland coast. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Seals sunbathe on a sandbank with an oil rig in the background in Texel, Wadden Sea. Photograph: Voorspoels Kurt/Arterra/Alamy Natural subsidence and gas drills are depressing the Frisian territory, which is mostly below sea level. The North Sea is also rising by 1.8mm a year, a rate likely to accelerate as climate change takes hold. NAM, a Shell-Exxon partnership, plans to start a gas drilling operation next year and three other wells could soon follow. Local people from 14 villages have formed a movement to resist them. “It’s all about money,” said Willem Schoorstra, an award-winning Frisian novelist from the group. “We had one talk with NAM and they constantly repeated that they would help us make the clean energy transition. But it’s crap. We don’t buy it. They only want to invest in it when they are drilling. They hold on to their old ways and destroy everything for the sake of money.” Beneath such talk is an attachment to the low-lying, ancient ground on which Romans, Vikings and Franks have trodden. “It’s the quietness, the view, the smell,” says Schoorstra, “the birds, the starry skies, the little whispers from the cockles, mudworms and mussels. You can go there twice and the whole landscape has changed. It is where the kids have their first love affairs.” The Wadden Sea tide ebbs and flows twice a day, bringing sand, silt and nutrients which blanket the mud flats in algae. This holds the sand banks together and provides food for the shellfish and smaller creatures that feed the birds and make the ecosystem’s life cycle turn. Johan Rispens, a local shrimp fisher, asks: “What will happen to our dykes when they drill for gas under the Wadden Sea? Will they crack? Will there be earthquakes? Why is it even necessary to take the gas from under the sea?” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michiel Schriers, governor of Friesland’s provincial capital Leeuwarden, holds a protest placard against the gas drilling in the area. Photograph: Arthur Nielsen Campaigners say some local house prices have fallen by as much as €50,000 (£44,000) each in the last five years due to fears of subsidence and the drilling-related earthquakes that have damaged an estimated 100,000 homes in neighbouring Groningen province. Michiel Schrier, the Socialist governor of Friesland’s provincial capital Leeuwarden, says: “After the earthquakes in Groningen, people woke up and now every time a contractor wants to take gas from the ground, the communities are revolting and coming together in protest. These movements are getting bigger.” Gas has been drilled on Ameland island off the Wadden Sea coast since 2006, and Schrier has himself taken part in many of the anti-drill demonstrations. NAM argues that it can contain subsidence by keeping “a hand on the tap” – to turn their operations off if geological monitoring shows cavities appearing which might not be filled by sedimentation. But the geological processes at work can take years to become apparent, and NAM’s technical blueprint was dismissed by the government’s mines supervisory board last week for a second time. NAM now has until November to address their report’s shortcomings, after which it could face fines of €500,000 a week. “We need a proper study and that’s what is not happening at the moment,” said Wouter Van der Zee, the manager of the mines supervision board. “The predicted amount of subsidence and the uncertainty band were just unrealistic.” If Shell does not correct inadequacies in its methodology, “we may have to advise our minister to reassess the gas production [plans] under the Wadden Sea,” Van der Zee said. Jeroen Jansen, a senior ecologist for Shell and NAM stressed that boreholes would be drilled from just outside the world heritage site to extract gas from the 200 billion cubic metre field that is directly underneath the mudflats. The drill was needed “so we can secure a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply in the future,” he said. “We are aware that the Wadden Sea is of high ecological value. If there would be a risk [of collapse], we would not do it.” Subsidence of 1mm a year under the flats and 3-4mm a year under the salt marshes had taken place since 2006, he said, as a result of the 25 wells drilled in the Wadden Sea area since 1985. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A NAM gas drilling rig near mud flats in the Wadden Sea Islands. Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Alamy Stock Photo A spokesman for the Dutch government said: “In the transition period towards a fossil fuel-free society, natural gas still has an important role to play. Whether we will eventually extract gas from the Wadden Sea is a different matter. We are still in the midst of a review procedure.” Gas is seen in the Netherlands as a bridging fuel to a low-carbon future, because it emits just over half as much CO2 as coal. This is still 18 times higher than concentrated solar power and 40 times higher than onshore wind. In Friesland, the widespread suspicion is that their government listens most attentively when money talks. “The Netherlands is a small country but we are very far from the Hague,” Schrier said. “They have a contract to deliver gas to other countries and it’s a big income for them.” The issue reached boardroom level earlier this year when Rabobank announced an embargo on new finance for gas exploitation under the Wadden Sea. The bank is a major mortgage provider in the area. ING and ABN Amro, two other major Dutch banks, quickly followed their lead. However, campaigners say that Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada and the ABP and Delta Lloyd pension funds are still keeping their investment options open. Candice Macdonald, a spokeswoman for Barclays, said that day-to-day interaction with one of the drilling firms, Tulip Oil, was now being undertaken by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) after a management buy-out of the bank’s natural resources equity office. “Barclays retains a minority [30%] stake in Tulip,” Macdonald said. “Tulip has ceased all development activities on the Wadden Sea project and has no intention to restart at the current time.” GNRI did not respond to calls for clarification but the firm’s environmental policy says that they will not back projects that break local laws. In a report on the financing of the gas projects, Barclays did not rule out work on the project resuming, subject to a “clarification of the Dutch mining law”.
