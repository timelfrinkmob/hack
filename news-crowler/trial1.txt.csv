"When I met with her last week, it was clear that she now understands these issues well at a policy level and that she has researched the implications of the positions that she has proposed."   McKesson’s move comes one day after Brittany Packnett, the co-founder of Campaign Zero, endorsed Clinton during an appearance on MSNBC.   Clinton has been a vocal supporter of Mothers of the Movement, a group of mothers who have lost sons to incidents related to police violence.

Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson endorses Hillary Clinton|One of the most prominent voices of the Black Lives Matter movement, activist DeRay Mckesson, has revealed his presidential pick for 2016, and he’s with her. “I am voting for Hillary Clinton,” Mckesson wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published this morning. “Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong.”  But he’s quick to point out that they don’t agree on everything, calling on her to oppose the death penalty and reform policies that result in mass incarceration. Mckesson developed a following after the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and subsequent protests. He’s become one of the best-known activists in the fight against police brutality, with BuzzFeed dubbing him “one of the most coveted endorsements in Democratic politics.”  He took his time before making his endorsement public, publishing it just 13 days before the election, perhaps a result of him once feeling tepid about the Clinton campaign.  “When Clinton started this campaign, she didn’t appear to understand the urgency of the need to address racism,” he wrote.   But his op-ed suggests he believes she’s made substantial growth in that regard:  I agree with Clinton more than I disagree with her... The [racial] unrest and activism over the last two years has undoubtedly pushed Clinton, specifically on key issues that she and other Democrats otherwise would not have addressed as forcefully as the party’s platform does: private prisons, an increased minimum wage, the role of institutional and implicit bias in sustaining unjust systems and acknowledging the need to address racism directly, to name a few. Mckesson said he’s concerned that a Trump victory would lead society to “grind on black and brown folks even more than it already does.” “Trump wants to take us back to a time when people like him could abuse others with little to no consequence, when people like him could exploit the labor of others to build vast amounts of wealth, when people like him could create public policy that specifically benefited them, while suppressing the rights and social mobility of others,” he wrote.  Some activists have chosen to remain mum on their presidential preference – and Mckesson said some of his peers have even suggested that a Trump presidency “would bring about a productive apocalypse ... and force us to confront everything that is wrong with the system.” But he said he disagrees. Mckesson’s endorsement follows a year of meetings with Clinton about racial justice. A meeting last week made it “clear that she now understands these issues well at a policy level and that she has researched the implications of the positions that she has proposed,” he said. “And we can, and will, hold her accountable every step of the way.” CBS reached out to Mckesson for comment and will update this story. |http://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-lives-matter-leader-deray-mckesson-endorses-hillary-clinton/|2017-05-05 7:0:22
Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson endorses Hillary Clinton|Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president Wednesday. “There is much work that lies ahead, and Clinton is ready and prepared to do the hard work,” Mckesson wrote in an op-ed published in the Washington Post. “And we can, and will, hold her accountable every step of the way.” Some prominent activists linked to Black Lives Matter, including Mckesson, have hesitated over whether to support Clinton’s campaign. But he said he does not believe in refusing to vote, and he agrees more than disagrees with Clinton. “Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong: It is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go,” Mckesson wrote.

Trump loses patience with his White House counsel|DeRay Mckesson was an active participant in major protests in Baltimore, Baton Rouge and Ferguson. | AP Photo Black Lives Matter activist Mckesson endorses Clinton By Louis Nelson 10/26/2016 08:08 AM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Black Lives Matter civil rights activist and former Baltimore mayoral candidate DeRay Mckesson plans to vote for Hillary Clinton, writing that the Democratic presidential nominee's “platform signals both deep understanding of the challenges and a plan to move us forward.” Writing Wednesday in The Washington Post, Mckesson said he has met at least twice with Clinton, once in October 2015 and once last week. And while his first meeting with the former secretary of state left him unimpressed with her positions on the issues of racial inequality and social justice on which he advocates, Mckesson said Clinton has since developed a strong grasp on them. Story Continued Below Mckesson was an active participant in major protests in Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Ferguson, Missouri. He was part of a group of activists who met with President Barack Obama, law enforcement officials and politicians at the White House earlier this summer to discuss the relationship between police and the African-American community. Specifically, Mckesson wrote that Clinton’s racial justice platform is strong because “it is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go.” He praised her proposals on policing practices and criminal justice reform, as well as her economic package, which he said is “akin to a New Deal.” “When I met with her last week, it was clear that she now understands these issues well at a policy level and that she has researched the implications of the positions that she has proposed,” Mckesson wrote. “In this meeting, she spoke both about the context of change and the concrete actions necessary to open new pathways of equity and justice.” Mckesson was clear that he does not agree with Clinton on everything and called on the Democratic nominee to call for the abolition of a federal program that allows for the seizure of money and property from individuals who have not been convicted of a crime. He also urged her to oppose the death penalty and fight for its elimination. “But elections do have consequences,” Mckesson wrote, which is why he said he will be voting for Clinton. He said the “Make America Great Again” slogan that GOP nominee Donald Trump has used on the campaign trail harkens back to a time of racial and religious prejudice in the U.S., when Jim Crow laws “masqueraded as the will of the people.” “I often hear some of my peers say that they may not vote, that a Donald Trump presidency would bring about a productive apocalypse — that the system would grind to a halt and force us to confront everything that is wrong with the system,” he wrote. “But we know that the system will not come to a grinding halt; it never has. In a Trump administration, the system would surely grind us, black and brown folks, even more than it already does.” “Trump is the first major-party candidate in recent memory who campaigns expressly on moving backward from today. It’s the only way he wins,” he added. “Clinton has the plan to move American forward. I believe in moving forward.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Louis Nelson lnelson@politico.com @louisjnelson This story tagged under: Hillary Clinton Endorsements 2016 Elections Hillary Clinton 2016 Black Lives Matter DeRay Mckesson Missing out on the latest scoops?

Published by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI)|  Print Leaflet Feedback Share » Facebook Twitter Digg Reddit Delicious StumbleUpon Blogger E-Mail Black Lives Matter’s DeRay Mckesson endorses Hillary Clinton By Gabriel Black 2 November 2016 Black Lives Matter spokesman DeRay Mckesson published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post last week headlined “Why I’m voting for Hillary Clinton.” Mckesson’s endorsement came several days after he and his Black Lives Matter colleague Brittany Packnett met privately with Clinton in Cleveland. Packnett endorsed Clinton following the meeting in an interview published in Elle. The two had previously met with Clinton a year prior. Mckesson, in particular, has been promoted by the Democratic Party establishment and the media as the voice of African-American opposition to police violence and racism. He is a fairly frequent visitor to the Obama White House. It is significant that Mckesson begins his article with a deferential reference to Shirley Chisholm, one of the early black politicians who secured a place within the political establishment. As a Democratic New York State legislator and then a member of the US House of Representatives from New York City from 1969 to 1983, Chisolm distinguished herself as a thoroughly conventional bourgeois politician. She was careful to distance herself from the more radical factions of the civil rights movement. “The next president will continue to shape the trajectory of justice and landscape of opportunity in this country,” Mckesson writes. “She will be responsible for how trillions of dollars in federal funding are spent, decide how to ensure both liberty and security in an increasingly interconnected world and determine the path forward on health care and Social Security.” Mckesson’s choice of words is telling, particularly the phrase “ensure both liberty and security.” This is one of those catch phrases used by capitalist politicians and think tanks to denote the violent and criminal policies pursued by American imperialism to defend the global interests of the US corporate elite. On this score, Mckesson’s choice for president has a long and unambiguous record: from supporting the invasion and occupation of Iraq to leading the drive for the US regime-change operations in Libya and Syria—illegal and criminal operations that killed many hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed entire countries. Clinton has as well played a leading role in the anti-Chinese “pivot to Asia” and is running an election campaign based largely on the demonization of Russia. She calls for the establishment of a “no-fly zone” in Syria, having acknowledged in a 2013 speech to Goldman Sachs that such a move would result in heavy civilian casualties. Mckesson notes in his article a few disagreements with Clinton, such as her support for capital punishment. Military aggression and war are not mentioned. Nor is Clinton’s opposition to any government jobs program, her support for Obama’s assault on health care under “Obamacare,” or her denunciations of Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. One looks in vain in his piece for the words “poverty,” “inequality,” “Wall Street” or “capitalism.” “Clinton has the plan to move America forward,” he writes, adding, “There is much work that lies ahead, and Clinton is ready and prepared to do the hard work.” He praises Clinton’s $125 billion Economic Revitalization Initiative, describing it as “akin to a new New Deal, structurally investing in youth employment, re-entry, small business growth and homeownership.” There is nothing progressive about this scheme. Like similar measures enacted by Obama and his Republican predecessors, it is based on the use of taxpayer money to provide tax incentives and other financial inducements for businesses to set up operations and hire workers at near-poverty wages. It is a continuation of the drive to turn the United States into a new low-wage center, where corporations can make fatter profits by “insourcing” jobs from overseas. Mckesson and others in the leadership of Black Lives Matter are enthusiastic backers of the plan because it promises to provide black capitalists with a share of the spoils. At one point he writes, “Trump is placing a bet that America can be fooled into thinking its greatness lies behind it—that restricting immigration and the rights of religious minorities and ending social welfare programs are things to be celebrated, as they have been in the worst moments of our history.” There are three notable things about this passage. First, it ignores the fact that it was the Democratic Party under Bill Clinton, supported by First Lady Hillary, which acted to “end welfare as we know it.” Second, it overlooks the fact that the Obama administration has overseen the biggest wave of deportations in US history. By the beginning of 2016, Obama had deported over 2.5 million people—23 percent more than George W. Bush deported over the course of his entire eight-year term. Third, like Obama and Clinton, Mckesson takes issue with Trump’s claim that America is not “great.” Like most of his upper-middle class milieu, he is complacent, self-satisfied and indifferent to the plight of tens of millions of Americans who have suffered through layoffs, pay cuts, soaring housing prices, and the gutting of social programs, health care and pensions. Mckesson, aged 31, is the district chief of human capital for the Baltimore city school district, where he makes $165,000 a year. This is about $50,000 more than what is required to be in the top 1 percent of Millennials. He lives in a world apart from the majority of Americans—black or white. He is “upwardly mobile,” and sees a Clinton administration as a springboard to bigger and better things to come. Just this past Sunday, Adweek, an advertising industry newspaper, published an interview in which Mckesson bragged about his personal friendship with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. “Jack’s a friend. I love Twitter. We talk about the platform, and we get to bounce ideas off each other,” he enthused. He also managed to get in a good word for Patagonia vests, noting that the firm’s CEO “emailed me when I got arrested in Baton Rouge.” He added, “They have been great about repairing my vest every time it rips and they have to restuff the down.” Why has this crass and ignorant nobody been so heavily promoted? Why are his banal political opinions featured prominently by the Washington Post and similar publications? There are two basic reasons. First, his insistence that race is the end-all and be-all of American life, and his characterization of American society as inherently and incorrigibly racist. Racial and sectarian politics have, from the earliest stirrings of American industrial workers in the 19th century, served as a political ideological weapon of the capitalist class to divide the working class. In the current election cycle, the ruling elite was stunned by the support that emerged for the campaign of Bernie Sanders, not because it had concerns over Sanders’ own political allegiance, but because masses of workers and youth responded on a class basis to Sanders’ claim to be a socialist and his call for a “political revolution” against economic inequality and Wall Street domination. The promotion of Black Lives Matter and other purveyors of racial politics, as well as proponents of other forms of middle class identity politics, was seen as a much needed counterweight. Racial and identity politics have, in fact, been at the center of the Clinton campaign and, to a great extent, bourgeois rule as a whole in the United States. Second, the ruling class is very aware of the need to groom and promote a new generation of black Democratic “leaders” to keep the masses of African-American workers and youth in check. It knows that Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and company are spent forces. Mckesson is eager and willing to fill the role. Careerism, self-promotion, the quest for a bigger share of the spoils of capitalism—such are the class concerns that drive the mainly upper-middle class figures who dominate groups such as Black Lives Matter. Which is why the Ford Foundation is investing $100 million in organizations linked to Mckesson and Black Lives Matter.   Commenting Discussion Rules »|https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/11/02/mcke-n02.html|2016-2-11 2:02:2
Black Lives Matter activist Deray Mckesson endorses Clinton|DeRay Mckesson is pictured in Aspen, Colo. in June 2016.  (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) Less than a week after meeting with Hillary Clinton, Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson has endorsed her. In an op-ed in The Washington Post Wednesday, Mckesson explained why he was finally backing Clinton. He has met with Clinton multiple times over the past year but has also made his disagreements with her known. “When Clinton started this campaign, she didn’t appear to understand the urgency of the need to address racism. When I first met with her in October 2015, she had not yet released comprehensive policy positions dealing with racial justice. She seemed slow to grasp why it was important to act with comprehensive proposed solutions. The unrest and activism over the last two years has undoubtedly pushed Clinton, specifically on key issues that she and other Democrats otherwise would not have addressed as forcefully as the party’s platform does: private prisons, an increased minimum wage, the role of institutional and implicit bias in sustaining unjust systems and acknowledging the need to address racism directly, to name a few. Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong: It is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go.” Mckesson said he still doesn’t agree with Clinton on everything. In his op-ed, he urged her to call for the end of the death penalty, end the government Equitable Sharing program and address the treatment of nonviolent drug offenders and others who have been impacted by mass incarceration. However, he added: “I agree with Clinton more than I disagree with her.” He warned against people voting for Donald Trump in the hopes of a Trump administration bringing a “productive apocalypse.” “We know that the system will not come to a grinding halt; it never has. In a Trump administration, the system would surely grind us, black and brown folks, even more than it already does," Mckesson wrote. Last Frida,y Clinton had a meeting with Mckesson and Brittany Packnett. Packnett is another Black Lives Matter activist who has also endorsed Clinton.

Black Lives Matter Activist DeRay McKesson is Voting for Hillary|Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson is supporting Hillary Clinton as the next President. In a Washington Post OpEd McKesson says he believes that as president, Clinton will “continue to shape the trajectory of justice and landscape of opportunity in this country.” Referencing Shirley Chisholm, McKesson sets up the importance of civic engagement despite “imperfect systems.” He calls out some of his peers who have said they would not vote at all - anticipating that the Trump presidency “bring about a productive apocalypse” whereby the system would inevitably “grind to a halt and force us to confront everything that is wrong with the system.” Hear @DeRay explain in an #LastWord #exclusive why he feels comfortable endorsing #HillaryClinton https://t.co/GRRRcidHBt— The Last Word (@TheLastWord) October 27, 2016 Though McKesson now says he will cast his vote for Clinton come Election Day, he has not always been in her camp. At times he has been an outspoken critic. McKesson writes that at the beginning of her campaign she “didn’t appear to understand the urgency of the need to address racism.” McKesson and fellow civil rights activists met privately with Mrs. Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders in October 2015, where they pushed the candidates to reform their plans on racial equality, community policing, and criminal justice reform. RELATED: DeRay Mckesson on Mayoral Race and Future of Black Lives Matter In an open letter, McKesson asked NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt and moderator of the fourth Democratic Debate to push Clinton to address issues such as racial inequality. The Campaign Zero co-founder has consistently questioned her plans for criminal justice reform. When someone compared her criminal justice reform policy to that of Bernie Sanders on Twitter, McKesson shot back, “Hillary is silent on community oversight, supports the death penalty, etc.” He also questioned her plan to increase funding for the Department of Justice. Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson talks to the media after his release from the Baton Rouge jail in Baton Rouge, La. on Sunday, July 10, 2016. Max Becherer / AP “Hillary has focused on a handful of issues with a handful of proposals, in a markedly more detailed way that speaks to implementation,” McKesson writes in his OpEd. “However, she has not addressed a variety of issues such as community oversight, the racial wealth gap, and economic justice.” McKesson says that he may not agree with Clinton on everything, however he agrees with her more than he disagrees with her. RELATED: Rocky Road to Equality: Ben & Jerry's Supports Black Lives Matter “Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong: It is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go,” McKesson says. “It acknowledges the need to establish new restrictions on police use of force and militarization, invest in treatment and rehabilitation as alternatives to police and prisons, and protect and expand the right to vote.” McKesson says Clinton policies still have room for improvement and there are things she still needs to address. He calls for the candidate to end the death penalty and include reform for mass incarceration. He also wants her to end the Department of Justice’s “Equitable Sharing Program,” which permits local police departments to keep large amounts of assets seized. DeRay McKesson greets a peloton of voters as he canvasses in Charles Village on March 26. Andre Chung / for NBC News McKesson writes that Donald Trump’s policies will not “Make America Great Again,” but take America backwards to an era of Jim Crow laws. “In a Trump administration, the system would surely grind us, black and brown folks, even more than it already does,” McKesson says. “Trump wants to take us back to a time when people like him could abuse others with little to no consequence, when people like him could exploit the labor of others to build vast amounts of wealth, when people like him could create public policy that specifically benefited them, while suppressing the rights and social mobility of others.” Since the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO in August 2014, McKesson has been a strong voice of the black lives matter movement. As co-founder of Campaign Zero, a data and research organization, McKesson has been one of many activists and civil rights leaders calling for an end to police violence against African Americans. In July, days after being arrested for protesting the police shooting death of Alton Sterling, McKesson along with civil rights leaders and law enforcement officers met with President Obama at the White House to discuss police shootings of black men across the country. Earlier this year, McKesson ran for mayor of Baltimore, but finished sixth in the primary. In June he was named Interim Chief of Human Capital for Baltimore City Public Schools.
