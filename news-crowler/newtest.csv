"Barack Obama calls Trumpcare 'massive transfer of wealth' from poor to rich"|"Barack Obama has called the Republican replacement for his signature healthcare legislation, Obamacare, a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and middle-class to the wealthy.  The former President and namesake for the existing Affordable Care Act healthcare law took to Facebook to express his concern over the replacement bill set to be voted upon in the Senate that would benefit the wealthy with massive tax cuts as well as pharmaceutical and insurance companies.   Mr Obama wrote that health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.  Mr Obama said that though repealing and replacing Obamacare has become a core issue for Republicans, we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course. The bill passed the House in May and until 22 June the Senate draft was kept secret from all but a few select Republican Senators by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  After the unveiling, four of the majority party's Senators made their dissent public.  Read more What is in the Senate's healthcare bill? “The current bill does not repeal Obamacare,” Rand Paul, one of the four Senators, along with Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Mike Lee of Utah, who have said in a joint statement that they're “not ready to vote for this bill.” With no Democrats planning to support the repeal and replacement, Mr McConnell and party can only afford to lose two members of their 52-48 majority in the Senate in order to pass the bill.  Several Democrats have admitted Obamacare needs fixing, but that abandoning it for the Republican replacement - known formally as the American Health Care Act - is not a viable option.  ”The president said the House bill was mean,“ said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. ”The Senate bill may be even meaner.“ Even Mr Obama wrote: I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts. He said that if Republicans come up with a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it.  Mr McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill. ”I regret that our Democratic friends made clear early on that they did not want to work with us in a serious, bipartisan way to address the Obamacare status quo. But Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,“ Mr McConnell said. A number of Republicans such as Susan Collins and Maine said it was “too soon” to judge the bill until they had had a chance to read it. Veteran Senator John McCain said the draft bill was better than Obamacare in 100 ways, but like many Senators wanted to study the bill further and consult with his state's governor.  States with a large population receiving Medicare, health insurance for seniors, or Medicaid, government-subsidised insurance for low-income or disabled people, may be negatively affected by the bill in its current draft.  With a third of the Senate coming up for re-election in 2018, many will have to weigh the state-wide implications before voting for the bill.  Read more Four Republican senators have said they 'plan to oppose' Trumpcare Democrats accuse Republicans of attempting to rush healthcare bill 23 million to lose health insurance under Trump's new bill, say CBO Mr Obama also wrote that politics could not get in the way of the compromise needed between Republicans and Democrats in order to not put the American people through [the] pain of being excluded from benefits while pregnant or sick, expensive bills, or high deductibles while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the House version of bill would leave 23 million people uninsured. It is expected to run the same calculations on number of insured and cost of premiums for the Senate draft bill early next week.  Mr McConnell is reportedly looking to schedule a vote on the bill sometime before the 4 July Congressional recess, which does not give much time to deliver what Mr Obama called the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines.  More about: Obamacare Barack Obama Trumpcare Reuse content"|"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/barack-obama-trumpcare-healthcare-bill-criticism-attack-transfer-wealth-poor-rich-a7805431.html"|"2017-06-23 17:13:37"

"Barack Obama Calls Trumpcare ‘Massive Transfer Of Wealth’ From Poor To Rich"|"Trumpcare is the association for mainly run by a government owned and it helps people from poor to rich in massive transfer of wealth. Barack Obama has called the Republican replacement for his signature healthcare legislation, Obamacare, a “massive transfer of wealth” from the poor and middle-class to the wealthy.

"Obama Begs Senate GOP Not to Hurt Millions Just to Spite Him"|"Keep America Less Bad Than It Was. Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Barack Obama is imploring congressional Republicans not to throw millions of people off of their health insurance for the sake of diminishing his legacy. The former president has largely held his peace through the first five months of the Trump presidency, opting to lead the resistance from behind — abjuring the spotlight, while working behind-the-scenes to cultivate the next generation of Democratic leadership. But with his signature health-care law on life support, Obama condemned the GOP’s plan to finance a capital-gains tax cut by throwing millions off of Medicaid in no uncertain terms. “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health-care bill,” Obama wrote on Facebook. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.” The president continued: It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely. Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation. Elsewhere in his post, Obama expresses the hope that Republican senators will “remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win,” and “consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.” Of course, the GOP’s rationale for repealing Obamacare isn’t merely about undoing what the first black president did — it’s also about redistributing hundreds of billions of dollars from the poor to the rich. But Obama’s missive’s true audience is less Mitch McConnell’s band of reactionaries, than his own supporters. The ex-president suggests that bipartisan legislation that genuinely improves the Affordable Care Act is possible, under certain conditions: If you’re willing to call your members of Congress. If you are willing to visit their offices. If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family. Obama’s confidence in the good intentions of his political adversaries, and the strength of the American republic, may, once again, prove misplaced. A good portion of the Republican caucus is more invested in transferring wealth from poor to rich than they are in retaining elected office. And there’s a chance that mass protests may actually make some of the party’s moderates (and/or amoral pragmatists) more eager to do their leadership’s bidding. As the Washington Post reported after the House passed Trumpcare: As GOP leaders scrambled to bring the last holdouts aboard in recent days, they made the argument that the liberal base is already on fire, anxious to take back control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. That means Republicans could ill afford to fall short on their health-care promise and risk depressing their own turnout. Which isn’t to say that progressives shouldn’t heed Obama’s call. Mass activism against the bill — aimed squarely at the Senate’s most vulnerable and/or moderate GOP members — is still the last, best hope of Trumpcare’s opponents. On Thursday afternoon, Maine’s Susan Collins suggested that she will not be able to support anything resembling the current bill. All is not yet lost. But it’s hard to fight the feeling that it will be soon."|"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/obama-begs-senate-gop-not-to-hurt-millions-just-to-spite-him.html"|"2017-06-22 18:01:33"

"Barack Obama: Senate Health Care Bill Is a Massive Transfer of Wealth to the Richest People in America"|"Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Former President Barack Obama took to his official Facebook page Thursday to criticize the Senate health care bill released Thursday, calling it “a massive transfer of wealth” to “the richest people in America,” and asking the Senate to “take a step back and measure what’s really at stake.” “Our politics are divided,” Obama wrote. “They have been for a long time. And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today.” Advertisement Calling it what it is, Obama wrote that “repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party.” He said that senators need to take a step back and measure what’s really at stake, because the rationale for action on health care or any other issue “must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.” And he’s right. Everything about this administration has been one long middle finger to everything the Obama administration put in place. The slow undoing of anything worthwhile in our government and public policies has been horrifying to watch. Our current president is the old-man embodiment of Regina George, and his entire administration is the Plastics, working their hardest to make everyone else in America miserable while they strut around patting themselves on the back for getting the job undone. Advertisement Obama continues: We didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain—we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course. He also notes that for the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans know the security of health care, and while health care costs continue to rise, they have been rising at the slowest pace in 50 years. Women can’t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free. Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition—we made that a thing of the past. Obama reiterates his previous point that while the Affordable Care Act was a significant step forward for America, “it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts,” and that if “Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost,” he would gladly and publicly support it. Advertisement Advertisement And since today’s big reveal shows that has not happened, Obama said that he hopes Republicans in Congress will remember that public service is not a gigantic pissing contest, or a dick-measuring one, and they should get down to the business of doing what’s right for the American people. OK, he didn’t use those words. He said that “public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there’s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it’s to make people’s lives better, not worse.” Same difference. But right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite. It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it. That’s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely. He rightly points out that if you get sick or start a family, this bill will harm you, and “small tweaks over the course of the next couple of weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.” Advertisement The bill is indeed mean. It matches the ugly, classist, ageist and racist tone of everything else that is happening under the current administration. The poor will suffer unnecessarily. The elderly will suffer unnecessarily. People of color will suffer unnecessarily. And for what? To prove that you can undo what the previous president did for no other reason than to show that your staff is bigger? To put the American people through that pain—while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return—that’s tough to fathom. But it’s what’s at stake right now. So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need. That’s not likely to happen, because simply put, this administration does not care about the American people. Advertisement Obama delivers a call to action, imploring the American people to reach out to their representatives (something we should all be doing daily until this stops) and let them know what this means for American families. After all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics. It’s about the character of our country—who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that’s always worth fighting for. Sorry, President Obama. It would appear that your replacement has turned the character of this country into a cartoon, and that is not likely to change until he and all his minions are thrown out on their asses."|"http://www.theroot.com/barack-obama-senate-health-care-bill-is-a-massive-tran-1796351420"|"1420-2-22"

"Obama Lashes Out at New Healthcare Bill: It’s a Massive Transfer of Wealth From the Poor to the Rich"|"Former President Barack Obama blasted the Senate bill to repeal and replace portions of Obamacare as “not a healthcare bill.” “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.” “I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,” he said. “Still, I hope that our senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on healthcare or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.” Obama noted that changes would be made to the bill but that he believed they would be just as harmful, invoking a term his successor, President Trump used, calling the House healthcare bill “mean.” “Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family — this bill will do you harm,” he said. “And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.”"|"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/obama-lashes-new-healthcare-bill-massive-transfer-wealth-poor-rich/"|"2017-06-22 16:57:47"
"Obama Blasts Senate Healthcare Bill As Massive Transfer Of Wealth To The Rich"|"A Senate Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is not a healthcare bill, according to former President Barack Obama. Obama said in a post on Facebook that the legislation unveiled on Thursday is instead a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill, Obama wrote. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Obama claimed the Senate Republican bill would would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it. The former president acknowledged that repealing and replacing Obamacare has become a core tenet of the GOP but argued that Republicans must accomplish more than simply undoing his signature domestic policy achievement. I still hope that there are enough Republicans in Congress who remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there's a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it's to make people's lives better, not worse, Obama wrote. He added, But right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite. Obama urged Republicans and Democrats to compromise to fix the problems with Obamacare, which he acknowledged is not perfect. I believe that's what people want to see. I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines, Obama said. Obama concluded his post by urging Americans concerned about the impact of the GOP plan to call their members of Congress and visit their offices. The post by Obama comes after Senate Republicans revealed the draft of a bill that would repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandates as well as the law's taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others while slashing federal funding for Medicaid. Democrats were quick to attack the proposed legislation, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., claiming the bill strips protections away from the people who need them most in order to give a tax break to those who need it least. Some Republicans also expressed dissatisfaction with the bill, as Senators Ted Cruz, R-Tex., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Mike Lee , R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ken., issued a joint statement saying they cannot support the plan in its current form. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., has little margin for error with the bill, as he can only afford to lose the support of two Republicans and still pass the legislation. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News"|"http://www.rttnews.com/2787162/obama-blasts-senate-healthcare-bill-as-massive-transfer-of-wealth-to-the-rich.aspx"|"2017-06-23 11:43:6"
"In 2015, Nine Percent Of U.S. Gun Deaths Were Due To Police"|"In post-truth era, semiotic hyper-reality blends the real and unreal and creates a set of signifiers that represent simulation of reality, hence replacing reason with emotion. On the other hand, cultural relativists across the entire spectrum of political affiliations tend to advocate/justify illiberal principles and ideologies. However, The Intellectualist is an independent news outlet and discussion forum which provides a fair and balanced medium to reflect global problems facing mankind, and a platform for public awareness and free exchange of ideas pertaining to existential challenges.

"Obama declares the Senate health care bill, “a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” and he’s right"|"Well, after weeks and weeks of secret discussions, Senate Republicans today shared a draft of their their health care bill, which, if passed, would replace Obamacare. Knowing the bill would be unpopular, the White House barred the news media from airing the press conference live. And, in hopes of diverting attention, Trump, at roughly the same time, took to Twitter to announce that, yes, he’d been lying a few weeks back when he’d suggested that he had secret tapes of him and former FBI Director James Comey discussing the Russia investigation. [According to Newt Gingrich, this was just an innocent little “bluff” on the part of Trump, who was, according to the former Speaker of the House, only “trying to rattle Comey.” Or, to put it a little differently, this was an attempt at witness intimidation on the part of the President.] Fortunately, though, the media, at least for the most part, stayed focused on the Senate health care bill, which the AARP was quick to label “harmful”. And with good reason, too. To quote former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough, the legislation “raises deductibles, cuts coverage and slashes Medicaid,” all of which are things that the President promised the legislation wouldn’t do. And it hits older Americans particularly hard… According to our friend Charles Gaba, who studies these things, a 60-year-old earning $37,000 would go from paying roughly $3,600 a year for a “silver” plan today, to paying roughly $6,000 for a “bronze” one under the proposed Senate bill. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg… Before we get into details, though, I wanted to share the following letter from former President Barack Obama, which was just posted to social media. Our politics are divided. They have been for a long time. And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today. I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party. Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did. We didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain – we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course. Nor did we fight for it alone. Thousands upon thousands of Americans, including Republicans, threw themselves into that collective effort, not for political reasons, but for intensely personal ones – a sick child, a parent lost to cancer, the memory of medical bills that threatened to derail their dreams. And you made a difference. For the first time, more than ninety percent of Americans know the security of health insurance. Health care costs, while still rising, have been rising at the slowest pace in fifty years. Women can’t be charged more for their insurance, young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they turn 26, contraceptive care and preventive care are now free. Paying more, or being denied insurance altogether due to a preexisting condition – we made that a thing of the past. We did these things together. So many of you made that change possible. At the same time, I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts – and that if Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it. That remains true. So I still hope that there are enough Republicans in Congress who remember that public service is not about sport or notching a political win, that there’s a reason we all chose to serve in the first place, and that hopefully, it’s to make people’s lives better, not worse. But right now, after eight years, the legislation rushed through the House and the Senate without public hearings or debate would do the opposite. It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it. That’s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analyses, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that 23 million Americans would lose insurance, to America’s doctors, nurses, and hospitals on the front lines of our health care system. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely. Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation. I hope our Senators ask themselves – what will happen to the Americans grappling with opioid addiction who suddenly lose their coverage? What will happen to pregnant mothers, children with disabilities, poor adults and seniors who need long-term care once they can no longer count on Medicaid? What will happen if you have a medical emergency when insurance companies are once again allowed to exclude the benefits you need, send you unlimited bills, or set unaffordable deductibles? What impossible choices will working parents be forced to make if their child’s cancer treatment costs them more than their life savings? To put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom. But it’s what’s at stake right now. So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need. That might take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans. But I believe that’s what people want to see. I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines. And I believe that it’s possible – if you are willing to make a difference again. If you’re willing to call your members of Congress. If you are willing to visit their offices. If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family. After all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics. It’s about the character of our country – who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that’s always worth fighting for. [And, yes, kids, that’s what real presidents used to sound like.] Make no mistake, this Republican bill was not drafted with any thought as to what the American people wanted or needed. It was drafted with one question in mind – “What can we get away with?” And we cannot allow the Republicans in the Senate to get away with it. We need to draw attention to this legislation, and let people know how it will likely affect their families. Here, with that in mind, are a few specific examples from Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. This Republican bill, says Casey, will decimate Medicaid: Page 86. Decimating Medicaid. pic.twitter.com/bRKuoMPCy5 — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) June 22, 2017 And end protections for pre-existing conditions: Page 135. This allows states to let insurance companies charge you more because of a pre-existing condition. pic.twitter.com/sKXdBNdxsg — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) June 22, 2017 And raise deductibles: This means higher costs before your insurance kicks in, also known as higher deductibles. pic.twitter.com/427Mpa0wfD — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) June 22, 2017 While we still don’t have a CBO score yet, and don’t know exactly how many people would lose their coverage if this bill should become law, we know already that a lot of people will be hurt. And why? To cut taxes on the wealthy. Again, this has nothing to do with what the American people want, need or deserve, and everything to do with a desire on the part of Republicans to make good on their promises to members of the donor class – the wealthy individuals whose financial contributions keep them in office. [This is another great reminder of why we need to get the money out of American politics, but, for the time being, we need to focus on killing this bill.] Fortunately, people are beginning to take notice. Organizations like the AARP are informing their members, and people are beginning to engage in civil disobedience… Speaking of which, 43 were arrested during a protests outside Mitch McConnell’s Senate office this afternoon, many of whom were pulled from their wheelchairs and dragged out of the building. Here, if you missed it, is a little of the documentation. Protesters with disabilities stage a die-in over cuts to Medicaid outside of Sen.

[The photo at the top of the post was taken in the White House rose garden after the House version of Trumpcare was passed.

"Obama Blasts Senate Trumpcare Bill As A “Massive Transfer Of Wealth” To The Richest People In America"|"Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation. I hope our Senators ask themselves – what will happen to the Americans grappling with opioid addiction who suddenly lose their coverage? What will happen to pregnant mothers, children with disabilities, poor adults and seniors who need long-term care once they can no longer count on Medicaid? What will happen if you have a medical emergency when insurance companies are once again allowed to exclude the benefits you need, send you unlimited bills, or set unaffordable deductibles? What impossible choices will working parents be forced to make if their child’s cancer treatment costs them more than their life savings? To put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom. But it’s what’s at stake right now. So it remains my fervent hope that we step back and try to deliver on what the American people need. That might take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans. But I believe that’s what people want to see. I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines. And I believe that it’s possible – if you are willing to make a difference again. If you’re willing to call your members of Congress. If you are willing to visit their offices. If you are willing to speak out, let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family.

"Barack Obama calls on Republicans to oppose Senate health care bill"|"Barack Obama calls on Republicans to oppose Senate health care bill “I hope that our Senators step back and measure what’s really at stake.” Barack Obama in Germany last month. Credit: AP Photo Shortly after Republican leadership finally pulled back the curtain on the health care legislation they have been working on in secret for weeks, reaction—much of it critical—began pouring in. None was more forceful or unequivocal than the reaction from former President Barack Obama. In a lengthy post published on Facebook, the 44th president beseeched Republicans in the Senate to consider the ramifications of the bill, which will strip health insurance from tens of millions of people, raise costs for millions more, and eliminate Medicaid protections that an estimated 75 million Americans rely on. The Senate version of Trumpcare may phase out Medicaid — entirelyThe meanest, most radical faction of the GOP got to decide what happens to poor people’s health carethinkprogress.org “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” said Obama in the post. “It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.” It’s unusual for a former president to weigh in so emphatically and so publicly on a piece of legislation currently up for debate in Congress, but as Obama himself notes in his post, politics should take a back seat to policy when people’s lives are at stake. “I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,” wrote Obama. “Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.” In his final press conference before leaving office, Obama said it was his intention to step back from the political arena. But, he added, there were some things that would compel him to break his self-imposed silence. “There’s a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake,” he told reporters in January. This isn’t the first time Obama has weighed in since Donald Trump took office, either. Less than two weeks after the inauguration, Obama issued a forceful statement condemning the administration’s efforts to ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries (now six countries) and suspend all refugee resettlement. He called on Americans to protest the ban. Of course, Obama’s 950-word statement wasn’t the only reaction from a U.S. president on Thursday. When asked for a comment about the Senate version of the bill, President Trump said “it’s going to be very good.”"|"https://thinkprogress.org/obama-asks-republicans-oppose-senate-health-care-bill-a41862c6abc3"|"2017-01-30"
"Barack Obama Just Blasted the Senate’s Trumpcare Bill"|"Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Former President Barack Obama released a blistering statement on Thursday condemning Senate Republicans’ plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, calling the draft legislation a “massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.” Our politics are divided. They have been for a long time. And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen… Posted by Barack Obama on Thursday, June 22, 2017 The remarks come just hours after Senate Republican leaders unveiled their draft proposal to undo Obama’s signature health care law, which includes cuts to both Medicaid spending and taxes on the rich.  In his statement Thursday, Obama warned Republicans of the dangers of circumventing the legislative process simply for the sake of delivering on a campaign promise. “I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,” the former president wrote. “Still, I hope that our senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.”   Since leaving office in January, Obama has largely abstained from directly criticizing his successor and various Republican legislative efforts. "|"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/barack-obama-just-blasted-the-senates-trumpcare-bill/"|"2017-06-22 16:28:33"

"Senate Health Care Bill Includes Deep Cuts to Medicaid"|"Other Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, expressed their own qualms, as did AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the Association of American Medical Colleges. Video How the G.O.P. Health Bill Would Change Medicaid The reporter Margot Sanger-Katz examines how the Republican health plan aims to roll back a program that insures one in five Americans. By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ, ROBIN STEIN and SARAH STEIN KERR on Publish Date June 22, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video » embed “We are extremely disappointed by the Senate bill released today,” the medical school association wrote. “Despite promises to the contrary, it will leave millions of people without health coverage, and others with only bare-bones plans that will be insufficient to properly address their needs.” Once promised as a top-to-bottom revamp of the health bill passed by the House last month, the Senate bill instead maintains its structure, with modest adjustments. The Senate version is, in some respects, more moderate than the House bill, offering more financial assistance to some lower-income people to help them defray the rapidly rising cost of private health insurance. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the Senate bill would make subsidies less generous than under current law. It would also lower the annual income limit for receiving subsidies to cover insurance premiums to 350 percent of the poverty level, or about $42,000 for an individual, from 400 percent. Older people could be disproportionately hurt because they pay more for insurance in general. Both chambers’ bills would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones; the limit now is three times. The Senate measure, like the House bill, would phase out the extra money that the federal government has provided to states as an incentive to expand eligibility for Medicaid. And like the House bill, it would put the entire Medicaid program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists. It would also repeal most of the tax increases imposed by the Affordable Care Act to help pay for expanded coverage, in effect handing a broad tax cut to the affluent in a measure that would also slice billions of dollars from Medicaid, a program that serves one in five Americans, not only the poor but also almost two-thirds of people in nursing homes. A capital-gains tax cut for the most affluent Americans would be retroactive to the beginning of this year. The bill, drafted in secret, is likely to come to the Senate floor next week, and could come to a vote after 20 hours of debate. If it passes, President Trump and the Republican Congress will be on the edge of a major overhaul of the American health care system — about one-sixth of the nation’s economy. The premise of the bill, repeated almost daily in some form by its chief author, Mr. McConnell, is that “Obamacare is collapsing around us, and the American people are desperately searching for relief.” Mr. Trump shares that view, and passage of the Senate bill would move the president much closer to being able to boast about the adoption of a marquee piece of legislation, a feat he has so far been unable to accomplish. Photo Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, held a news conference at which he criticized the Republican health care bill on Thursday. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times Democrats and some insurers say Mr. Trump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, in part by threatening to withhold subsidies paid to insurers so they can reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for millions of low-income people. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And President Barack Obama, who has been hesitant to speak up on political issues since leaving office, waded into the debate on Thursday, saying the Senate proposal showed a “fundamental meanness.” “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,” Mr. Obama wrote on his Facebook page. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.” In a message to his supporters, Mr. Obama urged people to demand compromise from their lawmakers before senators vote on the Republican bill next week. In the Senate, Democrats are determined to defend a law that has provided coverage to 20 million people and is a pillar of Mr. Obama’s legacy. The debate over the repeal bill is shaping up as a titanic political clash, which could have major implications for both parties, affecting their electoral prospects for years to come. Where Senators Stand on the Health Care Bill Senate Republican leaders unveiled their health care bill on Thursday. Mr. McConnell faces a great challenge in amassing the votes to win Senate approval of the bill, which Republicans are trying to pass using special budget rules that would allow them to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But with only 52 seats, Mr. McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie. Democrats have assailed Republicans for putting the bill together without a single public hearing or bill-drafting session. And Mr. Trump has been only fitfully helpful. He cheered on passage of the House version, then told senators it was “mean.” On Thursday, a White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, declared, “I don’t believe that the president has specifically weighed in that it’s right to cut Medicaid” — something the Senate bill decidedly does, as does the president’s proposed budget. Later, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was “very supportive” of the Senate bill. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republican leaders still must contend with internal divisions that will be difficult to overcome. Numerous Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid are concerned about how a rollback of the program could affect their constituents, and they face pressure from governors back home. Some Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine, said they were waiting for an analysis of the bill to be issued soon by the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on Capitol Hill. Graphic How Senate Republicans Plan to Dismantle Obamacare A comparison of the Senate health care bill with the Affordable Care Act. OPEN Graphic The budget office found that the bill passed by the House would leave 23 million more people without insurance in a decade. Under the Senate bill, the federal government would continue paying crucial subsidies to health insurance companies through 2019, alleviating the uncertainty caused by litigation and by mixed signals from the Trump administration. Without this money, many insurers have said, they will sharply increase premiums or pull out of the marketplaces in many states. The Senate bill would also cap overall federal spending on Medicaid: States would receive a per-beneficiary allotment of money. The federal payments would grow more slowly than under the House bill starting in 2025. Alternatively, states could receive an annual lump sum of federal money for Medicaid in the form of a block grant. State officials and health policy experts predict that many people would be dropped from Medicaid because states would not fill the fiscal hole left by the loss of federal money. “The Senate bill creates an illusion of being less draconian than the House bill, but is arguably more so” on Medicaid, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. Photo United States Capitol Police officers removed protesters from outside Mr. McConnell’s office on Thursday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The Senate bill would make it much easier for states to opt out of insurance standards in the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement for insurers to provide certain “essential benefits.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans said the bill would still guarantee access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. But consumers could be exposed to new medical costs if, for example, insurers did not have to cover certain expensive new drugs or medical procedures. “An individual with a pre-existing condition could be insured, but the services needed to treat that condition might not be covered because of a waiver,” said Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor of health law at Washington and Lee University. The Senate and House bills would both provide tax credits to help people buy health insurance, but Senate Republicans said they tried to direct more of the assistance to lower-income people. Under the House bill, the tax credits would be based mainly on a person’s age. Under the Senate bill, they would be based on a person’s income and age, as well as local insurance costs. The Senate bill, like the House bill, would cut off federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. The money reimburses clinics for birth control, cancer screenings and other preventive care. About half of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medicaid. Also like the House measure, the Senate bill would repeal taxes imposed on high-income people by the Affordable Care Act, including a payroll tax increase that helps finance Medicare. The bill would delay a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance — the so-called Cadillac tax — to 2026. It is currently scheduled to take effect in 2020. Employers and labor unions detest the tax and would have nearly a decade to try to kill it. The Senate bill would provide $50 billion to help stabilize insurance markets and hold down premiums from 2018 through 2021. The money would be distributed by the federal government to insurance companies that apply. The bill would provide $62 billion in grants to states for similar purposes from 2019 to 2026. In addition, the Senate bill would provide $2 billion next year in federal grants to help states respond to the opioid crisis. The bill would generally prohibit consumers from using federal tax credits to help buy insurance that includes coverage for abortions. Democrats plan to challenge this provision as a violation of Senate rules being used to speed passage of the repeal bill. Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

"President Obama Speaks Out On Trumpcare's 'Fundamental Meanness'"|"Former President Barack Obama took to his Facebook page after the release of the Senate version of Trumpcare to call everyone to action on the bill. He wrote, The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.

The former President called upon people to call their Senators, visit their offices, and speak out against this terrible bill. His call was an optimistic one. To put the American people through that pain – while giving billionaires and corporations a massive tax cut in return – that’s tough to fathom. But it’s what’s at stake right now.

The way I look at is there is no question we're getting inundated with calls and emails and protests. There is all this energy and anger on the left. The people who lost are the ones who are angry. We won the entire elected government. So I remind my staff after a long day of hostile calls, it was less than six months we got more votes than a person on the other side in [my state]. The people who voted for me are still out there. We are going to have to fight hard to keep this bill from getting through the Senate. Their incentives are huge for passing it. It serves their billionaires, provides huge tax cuts, and sets the table for Son of Huge Tax Cuts, also known as tax reform. They have lots of reasons for doing it, they're cynical as all get-out and they really don't give a damn about anyone but themselves. So I think President Obama may be optimistic. But I'm certainly willing to make this as difficult and painful for Republicans as I can anyway, and you should be too."|"http://crooksandliars.com/2017/06/president-obama-speaks-out-trumpcares"|"2017-06-22 13:42:14"

"Obama hard over Trumpcare: 'We zijn er om levens beter te maken, niet slechter'"|"Barack Obama heeft geen goed woord over voor de veranderingen die Donald Trump wil doorvoeren in de Amerikaanse zorg. Hopelijk herinneren genoeg Congresleden zich dat ze hun land niet dienen voor politiek gewin, maar om levens van mensen beter te maken, niet slechter. Obama spreekt zich op Facebook uit tegen het alternatief van Donald Trump voor de Affordable Care Act die hij zelf invoerde. Dat is bijzonder, want het is de eerste keer sinds de beëdiging van Trump dat Obama Facebook op deze manier gebruikt. 'We wisten dat het levens zou redden' Volgens Obama vocht hij tijdens zijn periode als president niet voor zichzelf. Ik zie dat het vervangen van de Affordable Care Act een belangrijk punt van de Republikeinse Partij is geworden. Wij vochten ervoor omdat we wisten dat het levens zou redden. Niet voor politiek gewin, schrijft hij. Ik hoop dat onze senatoren zien wat er op het spel staat en dat ze niet overgaan tot verandering simpelweg om iets van de Democraten ongedaan te maken, zegt Obama. Het nieuwe plan waarover gestemd moet worden, is volgens Obama een 'grote verschuiving van rijkdom'. De rijken zullen door het plan van Trump volgens Obama alleen maar rijker worden. Reactie Trump Niet lang nadat Obama zijn bericht op Facebook had geplaatst, reageerde Trump op Twitter. Obama sprak in zijn tekst niet één keer concreet over Trump, al was de boodschap duidelijk ook aan diens adres gericht.

"Hysteria rules Donald Trump’s White House."|"Trump has repeatedly lambasted the ongoing investigation into Russia’s involvement into the 2016 election as a partisan witch hunt intended to bring down his administration, as an excuse for Democrats upset that they lost the election, and, more broadly, as a hysterical response to his presidency. This narrative omits quite a lot. It omits that Russia did try to tip the scales in his favor, something that Trump never acknowledges. It omits the fact that he is the person who is most responsible for the widening of the investigation (it was his firing of James Comey that forced the Department of Justice to bring in Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor and that brought him under investigation for obstruction of justice. And, perhaps most of all, it omits the fact that Trump is the hysterical one. On Friday morning, The Washington Post reported the lengths to which the White House is trying to calm the president down about this investigation, which will likely run for months. Every morning at 6:30 a.m. he vents to his attorneys about the Russia investigation. The goal is to get Trump to rant in private so that he refrains from ranting in public: The calls — detailed by three senior White House officials — are part strategy consultation and part presidential venting session, during which Trump’s lawyers and public-relations gurus take turns reviewing the latest headlines with him.... By the time the president arrives for work in the Oval Office, the thinking goes, he will no longer be consumed by the Russia probe that he complains hangs over his presidency like a darkening cloud. It rarely works, however. Asked whether the tactic was effective, one top White House adviser paused for several seconds and then just laughed. This is completely bonkers, but it’s useful insofar as it shows how concerned Trump’s own aides are about his temperament—and how damaging they know Trump’s tweets have been. The tweet that raised the possibility that Trump was secretly taping his conversations with Comey is a case in point. On Friday, Mike Allen reported that Trump has told aides that he knows that it “hastened the chain of events that led to the appointment of special counsel Bob Mueller, who’s expected to delve into the business affairs of the president and his family.” And yet, for some reason, he’s still trying to publicly spin this tweet as proof that he’s a political genius. Fox News: So it was a smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings?Trump: Well, it wasn't very stupid I can tell you that.— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 23, 2017 But this doesn’t show that Trump is a genius. Instead it implies that James Comey was telling the truth about his interactions with Trump when he testified before Congress, something that Trump and his lawyers have vigorously denied. Trump may be venting to his lawyers every morning, but that hasn’t stopped him from making the hole he’s in even deeper."|"https://newrepublic.com/minutes"|"2017-06-22"

"GOP Plan Targets Poor, Sick, Elderly While Providing Tax Cuts for Wealthy"|"The Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will do active harm to millions of people, particularly low-income people and seniors; includes tax breaks for wealthy insurance CEOs; and is generally a nastier, more consumer-unfriendly proposal than even close followers could have expected. The American Healthcare Act (AHCA), unveiled by House Republicans Monday night, dismantles (pdf) major provisions of the ACA, or Obamacare, and puts in place a system of age-based tax credits for individuals to buy insurance. It would end Medicaid as we know it, as per Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), converting the program in 2020 from open-ended funding to a per capita cap system, where states would receive a set amount from the federal government for each person eligible for the program. In the past, analysts have usually projected that spending caps like those in the Republican plan would lead to fewer people being covered and less generous benefits, Dylan Scott wrote at STAT. The proposal would defund Planned Parenthood and other women's healthcare providers, as Common Dreams reported, and would roll back the ACA's requirement that health insurance plans cover essential benefits such as maternity care and mental health services. Furthermore, columnist Michael Hiltzik wrote at the Los Angeles Times, Everything from the tax on tanning salons and medical devices to the surcharge on high-income taxpayers will be gone. As we explained earlier, this amounts to an enormous tax cut for the wealthy—at least $346 billion over 10 years, every cent going to taxpayers earning more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples). The proposal would sharply raise the limits on contributions to tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts—another gimme for the rich. Not only is this giveaway a slap in the face to middle-class workers, but it advances Paul Ryan [and the] Koch brothers' major aim of abolishing Medicare, the Bernie Sanders-inspired political group Our Revolution declared on Monday night. Indeed, the Brookings Institution think tank confirmed: Repealing the ACA's tax on high income households and hospitals would exhaust the Medicare Trust fund by 2024. Meanwhile, [p]oor, older adults would face the largest crunch, the New York Times reported. The magnitude of their tax credits shrinks, even as a separate provision in the bill allows insurers to charge older people substantially higher prices than are allowed under the Affordable Care Act. Plain and simple, journalist David Dayen wrote Tuesday at The Nation: Under this bill, the average American will be more likely to be uninsured, or insured with higher co-pays and deductibles, or covered with a plan worth as much as the plastic insurance card it's issued on.  As for government-run programs, Medicare’s trust fund will come four years closer to depletion, and Medicaid will shed millions of people over time through a per capita cap, which is just as bad as a block grant, an inflexible funding outlay that fails to shift upward in times of need. Even if you get healthcare through an employer, the bill creates incentives for companies to throw people off insurance, sticking you in the aforementioned hazardous individual market. President Donald Trump called the plan wonderful in a tweet Tuesday morning. But healthcare expert Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA under former President Barack Obama, noted as part of his multi-part analysis that the AHCA violates all of Trump's campaign trail commitments, in that it covers fewer people, takes away critical protections afforded under Obamacare, and raises premiums and deductibles. An analysis presented last month by Physicians for a National Health Program argued that in fact, the only way for Trump to meet his campaign promises would be to enact a single-payer, Medicare-for-All system. Despite resistance from constituents and reticence from right-wing conservatives, GOP leaders hope to move quickly on their proposal. According to The Hill, House Republicans plan to take up the legislation at a breakneck pace, with two committees—Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means—scheduled to hold votes on Wednesday. A vote in the full House is expected to soon follow, within weeks. Such a vote would likely come in the continued absence of a Congressional Budget Office score for the proposal, making it impossible for the public or lawmakers to know the human or financial costs of the legislation. The fact that House leaders plan to plow forward with a markup of this bill without the typical Congressional Budget Office analysis of its costs and impact tips their hand: They know they cannot afford to tell the truth, columnist Isaiah J. Poole wrote on Monday. Their plan will hurt people who count on our country's important healthcare programs while giving a tax break to the rich. As sound health care policy, it just won't add up."|"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/03/07/gop-plan-targets-poor-sick-elderly-while-providing-tax-cuts-wealthy"|"2017-03-07 09:45:00"

"JUST IN: President Obama Issues Critical TrumpCare Statement To The Nation"|"Donald Trump is obsessed with former President Barack Obama. When Trump realized that making up wiretapping stories wouldn’t faze the former President or those who support him, Trump began once again resorting to personal attacks. Always professional, tactful, and diplomatic, President Obama has yet to come out swinging in the ways that others have. In fact, aside from rare instances of making his own stances on various topics known, President Obama hasn’t addressed Trump at all. Nevertheless Trump continues speaking and tweeting about Obama as if doing so will somehow positively impact the American people. While all of the above has been true for President Obama, everyone reaches a point when they can no longer be silent. On Thursday, breaking from his norm, President Obama took to facebook to share his thoughts on the GOP’s so-called health care plan. While it’s obvious that Trump and other Republicans are merely looking to undo the Affordable Care Act because it was an initiative of the Obama administration, the former President didn’t reduce himself to Trump-level tactics of making personal attacks. Obama stuck to facts. Acknowledging the ongoing division that hasn’t existed in ways it does now, but GOP seems to be encouraging through health care and other means, Obama said: ‘Our politics are divided. I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party. Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.’ With class and great tact, President Obama also refuted Republicans’ claims that Democrats wrote/passed the Affordable Care in secret, a tactic the GOP is actually guilty of: ‘We didn’t fight for the Affordable Care Act for more than a year in the public square. . .’ Not one to be consumed with appearing flawless, know-it-all, etc., Obama once again acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act wasn’t perfect, nor was it mean to be, but that it was a great step for a country that brands itself as being the greatest in the world, but didn’t have a system of health care for all: ‘At the same time, I was careful to say again and again that while the Affordable Care Act represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of our efforts – and that if Republicans could put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we made to our health care system, that covers as many people at less cost, I would gladly and publicly support it.’ Arguably the most important part of Obama’s statement, he called the GOP bill what it is – a “massive transfer of wealth.” He wrote: ‘The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.’ He also made it very clear who will be most hurt by the legislation: ‘Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.’ Some people may have wanted President Obama to make public statements every time he has been attacked by Donald Trump. However, by not doing so and being intentional with his words and when he uses them, Americans are once again reminded of the importance of tact and diplomacy; those are two attributes that the Trump administration has yet to display.

"Progressive Liberal"|"Health Obama Says Trumpcare is Based on “Fundamental Meanness” By Daisy Griffin Posted on June 23, 2017 Share Tweet Share Share Email Comments On Thursday, former President Barack Obama posted a lengthy statement on Facebook condemning the GOP’s efforts to repeal and replace his signature healthcare law aka Obamacare. The former U.S. leader believes that the new law is doomed to fail as it is based on “fundamental meanness.”  “I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,” Obama wrote. Trumpcare Should Not be About Politics He also urged Republican Senators to think twice before casting a positive vote to the new legislation and consider the “rationale” behind the GOP’s efforts to dismantle Obamacare. Obama underlined that a new healthcare plan should not be simply something that undoes what Democrats did. Obama noted that the Democratic Party did not have any personal or political gain from the bill, and they did not need a year to come up with the draft of the bill. Republicans, on the other hand, needed more than two months to secretly deliberate on the Senate version of the bill. Obama added that the Democrats fought for the law because it could set the U.S. on a healthier course by preventing poverty and saving lives. The former president voiced hope that there are still GOP Senators that can put Americans’ well-being above short-lived political wins. A Legislation Based on ‘Fundamental Meanness’ Obama blasted the GOP for “rushing” Trumpcare through the House and Senate without giving the American public time to think about it or leave the door open to public debate. He also criticized the current version of Trumpcare for being a “massive transfer of wealth” from the poor and the middle-class to the ultra-rich. Obama warned that the new legislation would harm every American that plans to start a family or simply gets sick or old. The former Commander in Chief is pessimistic that the tweaks designed to make the bill more palatable would improve the bill because there is a “fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.” Image Source: The White House Related Items: Share Tweet Share Share Email Click to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Yes it did cap federal funding over time. Here is the problem that absolutely no person wants to talk about. It has to happen. Right now Medicaid and SSI makes up about 57% of the federal budget.

For every budget dollar spent, About 45 cents is borrowed. That means we have went over the tipping point of spending. We literally use all our tax dollars on welfare programs. Well screwing with healthcare doesn't seem like the right way to go about fixing it when we spend such a ludicrous amount on military and while Trump is planning (and already asking) to spend billions on his wall. Then he has plans for cutting taxes too, right? Why couldn't we put some of that towards keeping Medicaid expanded? I'm not blaming Trump (except for the wall)- I'm sure Obama acted similarly regarding the military. Side note to everyone: can we keep the red vs blue trash talk down and for once maybe have a real discussion? Especially since this is inevitably going to affect many of us. Please and thank you. Reply » Report Abuse Judge it! dead on arrival Martin, TN #12 Yesterday Former President Barack Obama decried the Senate Republicans health care bill today, publishing a lengthy Facebook post calling it a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill, Obama said.Its a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.He continued:Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.The Senate bill would alter much of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Notably, it removes taxes that the ACA imposed to fund its expansion of coverage. These include taxes on high-income earners, medical companies and people who opted to not buy insurance.Obama has remained mostly mute on political matters since the end of his presidency, but has repeatedly spoken out against Obamacare repeal efforts that he says would be harmful to Americans who become sick, grow old or choose to have a family.

"From Kaiser Health News - Latest Stories:"|"Health Law With Health Plan, GOP Would Drastically Cut Medicaid And Fundamentally Reshape Program On Thursday, Republican leaders released the Better Care Reconciliation Act, their version of repeal-and-replace legislation for the Affordable Care Act. The New York Times: Senate Health Care Bill Includes Deep Cuts To Medicaid Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law’s mandate that most Americans have health insurance. The 142-page bill would create a new system of federal tax credits to help people buy health insurance, while offering states the ability to drop many of the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, like maternity care, emergency services and mental health treatment. (Pear and Kaplan, 6/22) The Wall Street Journal: Senate GOP Health Bill Would End ACA Penalties, Cut Taxes On High Incomes The bill would reverse the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, a move that could affect millions of people, and would for the first time limit states’ overall Medicaid funding from Washington. It also would eliminate the requirement in the 2010 law that most Americans sign up for health insurance, and provide instead less-robust tax credits than the ACA to help people afford insurance. It would repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on businesses and high-income households and retroactively cut taxes on capital gains. (Armour, Peterson and Radnofsky, 6/22) The Hill: Senate GOP Releases ObamaCare Repeal Bill With Deep Cuts To Medicaid  The Republican measure phases out the federal funding for ObamaCare’s expansion of Medicaid, which has provided coverage for about 11 million people in 31 states. (Sullivan, 6/22) The Washington Post: How The GOP Would Cut Billions More From Medicaid With A Single Letter Already, the version of the bill the House passed last month included drastic reductions in Medicaid outlays of about $834 billion over 10 years. GOP senators' own version of the bill, which they made public Thursday, could go even further over the long term. Both the House and Senate bills aim to set a per-person cap on Medicaid spending in each state. That cap would adjust annually to take into account inflation. Through 2025, both bills would adjust the cap based on a measure of how rapidly medical costs are expanding — a measure known as the CPI-M. Starting in 2025, however, the Senate bill would change the formula, instead funding Medicaid based on a measure of how rapidly all costs are rising (technically, the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, or just CPI-U). (Ehrenfreund, 6/22) Kaiser Health News: Senate Health Bill Would Revamp Medicaid, Alter ACA Guarantees, Cut Premium Support Since its inception in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending for Medicaid. The new bill would shift much of that burden back to states. (Rovner, 6/22) The Associated Press: Governors Wary Of Medicaid Cost Shift In Senate Health Bill Governors in several states that opted to expand Medicaid are wary of the Senate Republican plan to end the added federal funding for it within seven years. The proposal released Thursday calls for a slower phase-out of the Medicaid expansion than a bill adopted by the House. Yet it still would force those states to figure out what to do about the millions of lower-income Americans who used it to gain health coverage. (6/23) NPR: Senate Republicans Reveal Long-Awaited Obamacare Overhaul That's a big deal. It's a big shift, said John Corlett, president of the Center for Community Solutions, who also served as a director of Ohio's Medicaid program. It means billions of dollars less in federal aid to states for their Medicaid programs. (Kurtzleben, 6/22) Modern Healthcare: Senate ACA Repeal Bill Includes Tighter Medicaid Caps Than House Version  The Senate bill, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, would exclude disabled children, breast and cervical cancer patients and children covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program from the Medicaid cap formula. Experts say, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to protect any beneficiaries from the effects of the per capita cap structure, because states would receive fixed federal payments and have to make tough choices about cutting eligibility, benefits and payments to providers. (Meyer, 6/22) Kaiser Health News: Poll: Most Americans Unaware GOP Plans Would Make Deep Funding Cuts To Medicaid Congress is moving fast toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, with an eye on revamping Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people. But most Americans say the program — which Republicans call a “broken system” — is working well on the national level and within their states. That’s according to a monthly tracking poll released Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Luthra, 6/23) Nashville Tennessean: Veterans Speak Out On Health Care Bill, Say It Could Hurt 2 Million On Medicaid On the day Senate Republicans unveiled their health care bill, some military veterans say what the GOP rolled out is un-American. Veterans from across Tennessee said they're speaking out on behalf of 2 million veterans nationwide who they think will lose or see reduced health care coverage because of the move by Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Led by 36-year retired Marine Corps veteran Lt. Gen. John Castellaw, who lives in rural Crockett County in West Tennessee, he and others said the proposed health care bill would potentially boot millions of veterans off health care that many depend on to supplement coverage or just give them access to doctors. (Lowary, 6/22) Stat: Does The Senate Health Care Plan Have 'More Heart'? It Depends President Trump famously called the House plan to repeal and replace Obamacare “mean” — entreating Senate Republicans to make their version of the bill more generous. Just hours before the Senate unveiled its draft legislation, he repeated that plea. “I’ve been talking about a plan with more heart. I’ve said, ‘Add some money to it,'” Trump told a crowd in Iowa Wednesday night. (Mershon, 6/22) Health Bill Offers Insurers More Funding To Help Stabilize Individual Insurance Market The legislation would provide millions of dollars to insurers to cover the costs of expensive patients and costs incurred by very low-income patients, but the help would be short-lived. The Washington Post: Senate Republicans’ Claim Of Saving Individual Health Insurance Markets Could Prove Hollow Republicans have vowed for months to undo the Affordable Care Act and stave off the collapse of the nation’s most fragile health insurance markets, which serve people who buy coverage on their own. In the Senate, that turns out to be a short-term goal. Legislation that the Senate’s GOP leaders finally disclosed on Thursday would keep billions of dollars flowing — but only for two years — to health plans that have been begging for continued help with the expense of millions of lower-income customers in ACA insurance marketplaces. After 2019, the payments would stop. (Goldstein, 6/22) Bloomberg: Senate GOP Health Plan Adds Billions To Stabilize Markets, Source Says Senate Republicans’ proposal to replace Obamacare would provide $50 billion over four years to stabilize insurance exchanges in addition to cost-sharing subsidy payments through 2019, according to a person familiar with the plan. ... It also would provide $62 billion allocated over eight years to a state innovation fund, which can be used for coverage for high-risk patients, reinsurance and other items. (Dennis and Litvan, 6/22) The Hill: Senate Bill Contains $50B To Stabilize ObamaCare Markets  The Senate Republican healthcare reform bill would appropriate $50 billion over four years to try to stabilize ObamaCare’s exchanges. Republican senators agree that the insurance markets are collapsing because of ObamaCare, but there have been disagreements over whether the markets need to be stabilized before the law is repealed. The stabilization money, combined with the continuation of ObamaCare’s cost-sharing reduction subsidies through 2019, could lead some conservatives to say the bill keeps too much of ObamaCare. (Weixel, 6/22) USA Today: Senate Health Care Bill: Here's How It Would Affect You The bill would sunset in two years subsidies for people who purchase insurance on an exchange. Most of the more than 6 million Americans benefiting from the help may not be aware they’re getting it, since the subsidy goes directly to the insurer who then lowers the cost-sharing requirements for a plan. Without the subsidies, insurers would need to raise rates an estimated 20% to make up for the loss, experts have estimated. But the bill also includes funding for states to reduce insurance costs in other ways. (Groppe, 6/22) The Washington Post: How The GOP Health-Care Bill Would Address One Of Obamacare’s Big Problems — But Could Cause An Even Bigger One Currently, there's a maximum and a minimum level of income at which a person qualifies for federal help. The Senate bill would remove that minimum, meaning that everyone who makes less than 350 percent of the federal poverty level would qualify for insurance subsidies. That change is aimed at one outcome of Obamacare that nobody — neither critics nor supporters — ever intended. As planned, everyone making less than the minimum required for subsidies would qualify for Medicaid, which the law sought to expand nationwide. But when the Supreme Court gave states more freedom to decide whether they would expand the program, many states didn't. That left a coverage gap in many states and left approximately 2.6 million people in a maddening paradox: They made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but too little money to qualify for insurance subsidies. (Johnson, 6/22) Loopholes Built Into GOP Plan That Would Let States Bypass Preexisting Conditions Guarantees For example, depending on what states elect to do, somebody with cancer might be able to buy insurance but find it doesn’t cover expensive chemotherapy. Media outlets look at different aspects of the Senate's proposal and how they affect premiums, subsidies and public health funding. Kaiser Health News: Promises Made To Protect Preexisting Conditions Prove Hollow Senate Republicans praised the Affordable Care Act replacement bill they presented Thursday as preserving coverage for people with cancer, mental illness and other chronic illness. But the legislation may do no such thing, according to health law experts who have read it closely. (Hancock and Bluth, 6/22) The Wall Street Journal: Assessing The Impact Of The Senate GOP Health Bill The ACA’s protections for people with costly pre-existing medical conditions would stay in place. That means insurance companies couldn’t deny people with pre-existing conditions health coverage or charge them higher premiums. Under the House bill, insurers in some states could charge sicker people higher premiums, which conservative House lawmakers argued could help lower premiums for other people. But Senate lawmakers rejected that idea. States could get waivers to roll back benefits that must now be required under the ACA, and that could leave people with certain medical conditions paying more for their coverage. (Hackman, 6/22) The Associated Press: How The Senate Health Bill Compares To House,' Obamacare' The bill's impact on personal health care costs would be uneven: Premiums would likely go down for younger people, but older people would pay more. Out-of-pocket costs to cover insurance deductibles and co-payments would go up. For those who believe the government is too involved in health care, the Senate bill stands as an overdue course correction. But those who believe health care is a right will see it as a step back. (Alonso-Zaldivar, 6/23) Politico: Winners And Losers From The Senate Repeal Bill The Senate plan, like the House bill, would allow insurers to charge their older customers up to five times as much as younger customers for the same health plan. That’s an expansion of the so-called age band in Obamacare, which allows insurers to charge older customers no more than three times as much as younger ones. In two years, the Senate plan would also eliminate a key subsidy program that helps cover out-of-pocket medical bills for low-income consumers. (6/22) Kaiser Health News: Winners And Losers: 40 Is Old In Senate GOP Health Plan’s Subsidy Structure People getting subsidies to help buy health insurance would see at least three sharp changes — tied to both age and income — that could dramatically affect how much they pay for coverage if the Senate Republican health plan becomes law. The Senate bill released Thursday would reduce the income thresholds that determine eligibility, change the amount people who receive help pay toward their insurance premiums and peg subsidies to less generous coverage. (Appleby, 6/22) The Washington Post: Senate GOP Bill Would Gut Critical Public Health Funding This Fall The health-care bill that Senate Republicans released Thursday would eliminate critical funds for core public health programs that make up about 12 percent of the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The money supports programs to prevent bioterrorism and disease outbreaks, as well as to provide immunizations and screenings for cancer and heart disease. (Sun, 6/22) The Washington Post: Republicans’ Obamacare Repeal Bill Has A Small Bonus Just For Insurance CEOs Health insurance executives stand to be the sole beneficiaries of a small provision in Republicans' bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Both the House and Senate repeal measures would free insurance companies from a part of the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — that effectively makes it more expensive for them to pay their CEOs. (Ehrenfreund, 6/22) $2B Included To Fight Opioid Epidemic Far Short Of The Funding Some Republicans Were Seeking Republican senators in states that have been hit hard by the crisis were seeking $45 billion over 10 years. The Wall Street Journal: Health Bill Includes Opioid Funding, But May Not Satisfy Some GOP Senators The Senate GOP’s health-care bill would offer $2 billion for opioid addiction treatment for one year, falling short of the $45 billion over 10 years some Republican senators wanted. The funding’s inclusion in the Senate version of the health-care overhaul comes after weeks of protest from House and Senate Republicans who feared steep cuts to Medicaid would worsen an already growing opioid crisis, with Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia leading the push. (Nunn, 6/22) The Washington Post: Limited Coverage, Subsidies For Some In Senate GOP’s Proposed Health-Care Overhaul The Senate Republicans’ Better Care Reconciliation Act would significantly affect health coverage for many Americans, whether through the individual insurance market or Medicaid. Here are a few examples of how. ... The Senate bill provides $2 billion in fiscal 2018 for substance abuse treatment and recovery, but eventually it would take away much more by rolling back Medicaid expansion in 2020, capping federal payments to states and allowing them to change what qualifies as an essential service. Right now, all insurers and Medicaid must offer drug treatment benefits that are on par with their benefits for physical conditions. If this man’s state decided that substance abuse treatment was no longer an essential service, coverage for that care could be eliminated. (McGinley, Bernstein and Sun, 6/22) Stat: Opioid Crisis Funding In Senate Health Care Bill Is Limited The health care bill unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday includes funding to help tackle the nation’s opioid crisis — but dramatically less than the amount sought by two GOP senators and recovery advocates. Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) at one point had requested $45 billion over the course of a decade to keep the battle against opioids on the nation’s front burner. The bill instead would allocate only $2 billion, all in 2018. (Facher, 6/22) St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Senate Health Care Bill Weakens Patient Protections, Caps Medicaid Funding The Senate’s bill allocates $2 billion in 2018 for treatment and services related to the epidemic of people addicted to prescription pain pills and heroin. As many as 65,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year, the majority of deaths caused by opioids. Only 1 out of 10 Americans with a substance use disorder gets treatment, according to Howard Weissman, executive director of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse based in Olivette. (Liss and Bernhard, 6/22) Nashville Tennessean: Senate Health Care Bill Contains $2 Billion To Address Opioid Crisis, A Fraction Of What Some Had Hoped But Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said the bill increases resources to fight the opioid crisis and that some senators are likely to lobby for additional funding when the legislation goes to the Senate floor next week. It’s by far the largest amount Congress has ever appropriated in one year for opioids,” Alexander said in an interview. (Buie, 6/22) Senate Plan Would Give Corporations, High Income Earners A $1 Trillion Tax Cut The draft released by Senate leaders would delay the Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance and repeal the health law's taxes on investment income, high-income Medicare beneficiaries, employers who don't offer insurance, people who don't get insurance, medical devices and tanning services. The Associated Press: Senate GOP Health Bill: Tax Cuts For Rich Senate Republicans' new health bill cuts taxes by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, mostly for corporations and the richest families in America. It uses a budget gimmick to comply with Senate rules against adding to the federal government's long-term debt. (Ohlemacher, 6/23) Bloomberg: Obamacare Taxes Torched In Senate Bill, Drawing Democratic Ire  The long-awaited Obamacare replacement plan from Senate Republicans wouldn’t do much to preserve coverage for millions of poor and working-class people, but it would deliver tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. To appeal to their moderate members, GOP leaders initially faced pressure to maintain some of the Obamacare taxes that funded expanded Medicaid coverage. Instead, the Senate version mirrors the House bill in seeking to repeal almost all of the Obamacare taxes, which largely affect the highest earners. (Kapur, 6/23) The Wall Street Journal: How The Senate Health Bill Differs From House Bill, Obamacare The bill also knocks down many of the ACA’s taxes, including a 3.8% tax on investment income. The Cadillac tax would be retained but wouldn’t go into effect until 2026. It would end a tax on indoor tanning, repeal limits on contributions to flexible-spending accounts and stop taxes on health-insurance premiums.The tax on medical devices would also be repealed. (Armour, 6/22) The Hill: Senate Bill Would Repeal Most ObamaCare Taxes, Delay Cadillac Tax  The Senate draft healthcare bill unveiled Thursday takes a similar approach to ObamaCare's taxes as the House bill — repealing most of them with the exception of the Cadillac tax. The Cadillac tax, which applies to high-cost health insurance plans, would be delayed until 2026 in both the Senate and House bills. The tax is unpopular with both Republicans and Democrats and has never taken effect. However, the tax has been estimated to raise a significant amount of revenue that could help pay for other provisions in the bills. (Jagoda, 6/22) Defunding Of Planned Parenthood Slammed: 'Women Of America Should Have Fear Struck' In Their Hearts The Republicans' plan strips federal funding for the organization for a year. The Wall Street Journal: Planned Parenthood Restriction Could Pose Problem For Centrist Senators The Senate health bill released Thursday strips federal Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood Federation of America for one year and tightens restrictions on abortion coverage, creating potential sticking points for centrist senators. The Planned Parenthood measure, which mirrors a provision in the House version of the bill, would disqualify the network of women’s health clinics from receiving federal Medicaid funding, stripping the organization of hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially forcing some clinics to shutter. (Hackman, 6/22) The Hill: Senate GOP Bill Defunds Planned Parenthood For One Year  The Senate healthcare bill, revealed Thursday, defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, despite concerns that the move would not meet budget rules. The GOP bill follows the same language in the House-passed healthcare bill in blocking Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, which provides women's healthcare and abortion services. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (Ala.) and Susan Collins (Maine), have already suggested they may not support the bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood. (Hellmann, 6/22) CQ Roll Call: Abortion Opponents Pleased That Senate Bill Would Add Limits Abortion rights advocates were dismayed when Senate Republicans on Thursday released the draft of their health care bill, which retains language from the House bill to effectively defund Planned Parenthood for one year and prohibit certain tax credits from being used for marketplace insurance policies that cover abortion. These provisions were at risk for being cut due to concerns that the language could encounter parliamentary issues. During the reconciliation process, provisions must have a budgetary impact. The Byrd rule prohibits including language that is designed primarily to make a policy change rather than for budget reasons. (Raman, 6/22) Senate Health Bill Includes House Provision To Cut N.Y. Counties' Medicaid Obligations The bill would have additional repercussions for other states, too. For instance, because of state law, Illinois could feel the cutback in Medicaid faster than other states. News outlets look at some of the concerns in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Virginia, California and Georgia. Albany (N.Y.) Times Union: Faso-Collins Medicaid Provision Remains In Senate GOP Health Care Bill A provision that would require New York state to pick up the county share of Medicaid costs has been included in the U.S. Senate Republican health care bill, which was released Thursday morning. The idea behind that piece is that if counties are alleviated of the Medicaid burden they currently shoulder, they can look to reduce property taxes. But state officials have estimated that should that provision become law, the state would be out $2.3 billion beginning in 2020. That provision, authored by GOP Congressmen John Faso of Kinderhook and Chris Collins of western New York, is a carryover form the House’s American Health Care Act. (Hamilton, 6/22) Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat & Chronicle: Medicaid Would Shift To NY Under Senate Health Bill Counties in New York would be off the hook for paying for Medicaid costs under the U.S. Senate's health care bill Thursday, which included a controversial measure that was part of the House bill approved last month. ... Counties have said the change would alleviate them of having to pay about 13 percent of the state's overall Medicaid cost — and thus it would provide property-tax relief to residents. We are on track to ending the Obamacare nightmare, and I am pleased with the progress made today to bring vital reforms and the largest property tax reduction ever enacted to western New York, Collins said in a statement. (Spector, 6/22) Chicago Tribune: Medicaid Expansion Could End Early In Illinois Under Senate Obamacare Replacement Bill Many low-income adults across the nation could lose Medicaid expansion coverage under the Senate's Obamacare replacement bill — but in Illinois those losses could come three years earlier because of a state law. About 650,000 Illinois residents could lose their Medicaid expansion coverage in 2021, if the Senate bill becomes law and a state statute, meant to keep Illinois' Medicaid expenses in check, remains in place. (Schencker, 6/22) Nashville Tennessean: How The Senate Health Care Bill Impacts Tennessee And Other States The Senate's health care proposal repeals taxes, restructures and caps Medicaid funding, while immediately giving state insurance commissioners leeway to change plan benefits. At its core, the proposal works to reduce the federal government's health care expenditures by giving states more autonomy — and thus financial exposure — to craft insurance regulations and how Medicaid works in their states, experts said. (Fletcher, 6/22) Richmond Times-Dispatch: State Says Senate Health Plan Puts Virginia At Disadvantage, 'Harsher' Than House Proposal Virginia legislative budget leaders had a quick response to a new health care plan proposed by Republicans in the U.S. Senate — please don’t do what you just did. The Republican co-chairmen of the Joint Subcommittee for Health and Human Resources Oversight said Thursday that the Senate’s current proposal “fails to address the inequities in the federal funding allocation between states” for the Medicaid program that Virginia has operated in partnership with the federal government for a half-century. (Martz, 6/22) Sioux Falls, S.D. Argus Leader: Daugaard: Medicaid Cuts Could Bring Crucial Savings A proposal to slash funding to Medicaid could be the only opportunity to shrink the federal deficit in a divided Congress, Gov. Dennis Daugaard said Thursday. The Republican governor said shrunken Medicaid funding laid out in the Better Care Reconciliation Act, shared Thursday by a group of Senate Republicans, could create needed savings for the federal government. That might be the only way that we will ever get control of spending, Daugaard said. (Ferguson, 6/22) Sacramento Bee: Millions Of Californians Could Lose Medi-Cal Coverage Under Republican Health Care Plan For the first year in history, over half of all visits to Sacramento County’s emergency rooms in 2016 were paid for using Medi-Cal, the state’s insurance program for the poor that was expanded by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. So what happens to those people if Obamacare is repealed by the U.S. Congress? (Xu, 6/22) Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Study: Atlanta Hospital Most Vulnerable To Medicaid Cuts If the Obamacare revision the U.S. House of Representatives passed in May became law, the Georgia hospital to lose the most Medicaid funding would be Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Hughes Spalding, according to a new analysis by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. ... Children’s hospitals are particularly reliant on Medicaid, since unlike adults, most low-income children in Georgia can be covered under the program. Children’s Healthcare at Hughes Spalding gets about 65 percent of its revenues from Medicaid, GPBI said. (Hart, 6/22) Four Republicans Swiftly Announce Opposition, Endangering Bill's Chance Of Passage Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) release a joint statement about their problems with the legislation, but their stances appear to be negotiable. The Associated Press: McConnell Faces Hunt For GOP Votes For Senate Health Bill Shortly after the 142-page bill was distributed, more than a half-dozen GOP lawmakers signaled concerns or initial opposition. McConnell, R-Ky., has little margin for error: Facing unanimous Democratic opposition, no votes by just three of the 52 GOP senators would sink the legislation. McConnell, eager to approve the legislation next week, indicated he was open to changes before it reaches the Senate floor. But he said it was time to act. No amount of 11th hour reality-denying or buck-passing by Democrats is going to change the fact that more Americans are going to get hurt unless we do something, he said. (Fram and Alonso-Zaldivar, 6/23) Los Angeles Times: Republican Senators Seek Changes In Obamacare Repeal Bill They Can All Agree On. It Won't Be Easy Within just a few hours, four key conservative senators — Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky — jointly announced they could not possibly vote for the bill as is, unless it more fully guts the Affordable Care Act. Likewise, centrists withheld their support unless they can push the bill the other way, as they mull the fallout from leaving millions more Americans uninsured. (Mascaro, 6/22) Roll Call: The ‘Wait And See’ Caucus Vs. The ‘Not Yet’ Quartet The quartet wields enough influence to sink the legislation should they all choose to vote against the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he will bring it to the chamber floor for a vote late next week. Under the fast-track budget procedure known as reconciliation that the GOP is using to advance the bill, McConnell can afford only two defections, which would give him 50 votes and allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie. (Williams, 6/23) The Washington Post: McConnell Decides To Call GOP Colleagues’ Bluff With Health-Care Proposal After weeks of secretive talks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finally unveiled his proposal to dramatically reshape the health-care industry knowing full well that — as currently written — it lacks the votes to win approval. But using a time-honored tactic of congressional leadership, the Kentucky Republican decided it was time to call the bluff of his GOP colleagues. (Kane, 6/22) USA Today: Senate Health Care Bill Already Under Fire From GOP Members Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor, Paul, Cruz, Johnson and Lee said in a joint statement. There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.

(Bolton, 6/22) NPR: Senate Health Care Bill Could Be In Jeopardy As Conservatives Announce Opposition The Tea Party-aligned group FreedomWorks also said in a statement that the bill doesn't live up to promises by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of a full repeal of the ACA. Unfortunately, the Senate bill is an amendment to ObamaCare, not a repeal of it, said FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon. (Taylor, 6/22) The Washington Post: Senate GOP’s Health Plan Debuts Amid Doubts No Republican senators definitively said they would vote against the bill, instead focusing attention on the provisions that would need to be changed to earn their vote.

(Sullivan, Snell and Eilperin, 6/22) USA Today: Senate Health Care Bill Analysis: Despite Risk, Republicans Don't Have A Choice For Senate Republicans, the only thing worse than voting on a controversial health care bill may be not voting on it.

If three vote against it, the bill would fail. (Phillips, Fischer-Baum, Schual and Uhrmacher, 6/22) The New York Times: Where Senators Stand On The Health Care Bill Every Democrat is expected to oppose the bill, which means three Republican “no” votes would block it.

(Parlapiano and Benzaquen, 6/22) The Wall Street Journal: The Tough Math For The Senate GOP Health Plan The Senate GOP health-care bill is facing intense scrutiny from several of the majority party's own members. One faction consists of centrist Republicans, many of whom hail from states that have seen a growing share of residents with health insurance. (Rust and Shin, 6/22) The Hill: Rocky Rollout For Senate Healthcare Bill Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the most vulnerable Republican senator facing reelection next year, said he has “serious concerns about the bill’s impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), another centrist, criticized the bill’s effort to rein in Medicare costs starting in 2025 by imposing indexing it to a lower inflation measure than what House Republicans used in their bill. “It is lower than the cost of medical inflation and would translate into literally billions of dollars of cuts and that would mean states would be faced with very unpalatable cases of restricting eligibility or allowing rural hospitals to go under, she said in a statement. (Bolton, 6/22) KCUR: Missouri’s Senators Stand Poles Apart On Senate Health Care Bill  When it comes to the “discussion draft” to replace Obamacare that U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled Thursday, Missouri’s two senators could not be farther apart. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt praised the measure, claiming it would address the “disaster” that is Obamacare, the name by which the Affordable Care Act is commonly known. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill blasted the bill, saying it’s “exactly what you’d expect when the future of health care gets negotiated in a secret backroom deal. You get a bill that hikes costs for working families, strips protections from Missourians who’ve been sick before, and slices critical resources for rural health care and anti-opioid efforts.” (Margolies, 6/22) Des Moines Register: Grassley, Ernst Show Receptiveness To Health Bill Iowa's two U.S. senators didn't immediately commit themselves Thursday to their party's newly unveiled plan to scale back Obamacare, but they both voiced support for the need to make major changes to the nation's health care system. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, both Republicans, said they would withhold judgment on the health reform bill until they’ve studied the document, which Republican colleagues wrote behind closed doors.

While waiting for Thursday’s unveiling of the Senate's draft, conservatives raised concerns about concessions expected to be made to moderates in that chamber. “It’s moved to the left.

The first vote will be on a motion to proceed to the bill, which would need a simple majority to advance the bill.

The New York Times: How Senate Republicans Plan To Dismantle Obamacare Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a draft of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which they expect to vote on next week. The bill is similar to the one passed by the House in May, but it makes several significant alterations, including deeper cuts and structural changes to Medicaid, a program that insures one in five Americans, including two-thirds of nursing home residents. (Park and Sanger-Katz, 6/22) Politico: GOP Senate Health Care Bill: What You Need To Know The Senate’s sweeping Obamacare repeal has the same overarching goals as the House-passed American Health Care Act, including an overhaul of Medicaid, striking many of the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations and coverage mandates and getting rid of Obamacare taxes. But the chambers diverge in some important ways. (Bettelheim, Millman, Frostenson, 6/22) NPR: 9 Things To Know About The Senate Health Care Bill Republicans in the Senate on Thursday unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. The long-awaited plan marks a big step towards achieving one of the Republican party's major goals. (Grayson, Hurt and Kodjak, 6/22) Modern Healthcare: How ACA, AHCA And BCRA Compare  The Better Care Reconciliation Act, like the American Health Care Act, radically revises Medicaid, but it is closer to the Affordable Care Act on how it approaches subsidies to buy individual insurance. Both the House and Senate bills eliminate taxes that paid the costs to cover more people through Medicaid and to subsidize individual plans. (Lee, 6/22) McConnell And His Health Plan: Skilled Strategist Is Keeping Cards Close To Chest The precarious fate of the legislation is resting on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's shoulders. The New York Times: McConnell’s Calculation May Be That He Still Wins By Losing When it comes to managing Republicans’ best interests, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, rarely loses. So it is possible that Mr. McConnell views the potential failure of a hastily written health care bill as an eventual boon. ... Mr. McConnell plays his strategic cards so close to the vest that a queen of hearts must be tattooed on his tie. (Steinhauer, 6/22) The Associated Press: Analysis: McConnell Stakes It All On Health Care Bill The shrewd Kentuckian has made himself practically the sole arbiter of the bill and will be largely responsible for the outcome, whether it's a win, a loss, or a win that turns into a loss over time as unpopular consequences of the legislation take hold. McConnell decided to keep the bill close, writing it in secret with a close circle of aides and eschewing committee hearings, despite grumbling from fellow Republicans. GOP senators were largely in the dark until the legislation was unveiled Thursday and were still getting briefed, without seeing copies of the bill, when it was posted publicly online. (Werner, 6/23) Politico: Inside McConnell’s Plan To Repeal Obamacare McConnell’s strategy has been a slow burn, allowing his members to vent in private party discussions while gradually writing a bill that takes in their considerations over the past six weeks. He’s had more than 30 meetings with his members about taking down the 2010 health law, intended to give his members more input and get them comfortable with the product. Johnson, for example, doesn’t even serve on the two committees that oversee health care policy, so the process has empowered him more than he might have been through regular order. People close to McConnell believe Lee’s staff has been read in more than any other member on the chamber’s complicated parliamentary procedures that constrain what is possible under reconciliation. (Everett, 6/22) The Washington Post: Disability Advocates Arrested During Health Care Protest At McConnell’s Office Dozens of people protested the newly proposed Republican health-care legislation outside the Capitol Hill office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday — a demonstration that resulted in the arrest of 43 disability advocates. U.S. Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki said officers warned the demonstrators to “cease their unlawful activities” or risk being arrested.

(Stein, 6/22) The Hill: Police Remove Protesters Opposed To ObamaCare Repeal From McConnell's Office  U.S. Capitol Police officers removed several people protesting Thursday morning in front of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) office, shortly after the Senate GOP released its ObamaCare repeal bill. The protesters, some of them in wheelchairs, had planned to stage a die-in protest to oppose the bill. Tweets from the scene show Capitol Police officers blocking the hallway outside McConnell's office, as protesters gathered to protest the new healthcare bill. Another tweet shows police carrying a protester who refused to leave on her own. (Delk, 6/22) Trump Tweets That 'I Am Very Supportive' Of Senate Health Plan President Donald Trump also called the four Republicans who say they can't vote for the Senate bill in its current form, good guys. Roll Call: Trump Is ‘Very Supportive’ Of Senate Health Care Bill President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday evening that he is “very supportive” of the health care bill crafted by Senate Republican leadership, departing from an earlier more cautious approach by his White House communications team. The president’s support for the bill — which proposes Medicaid cuts, and an end to the 2010 health care law’s individual mandate — comes as Senate leaders must win over several conservative senators who on Thursday announced they have concerns with the measure. It is unclear whether Trump’s support will help bring those conservatives on board. (Bennett, 6/22) Los Angeles Times: Senate Obamacare Repeal Bill Would Slash Federal Healthcare Funding For Medicaid Trump said Wednesday night at a campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that he had told senators to “add some money to it” to produce a healthcare bill with “heart.” Asked Thursday morning whether the Senate draft met that standard, the president suggested some changes were needed. A little negotiation, but it's going to be very good, he told reporters. (Levey and Mascaro, 6/22) Roll Call: Trump Says Senate GOP Health Care Holdouts Are ‘Four Good Guys’ President Donald Trump called four conservative holdouts who could wreck Senate Republican leaders’ health care bill “good guys,” saying there is a “narrow path” to win their support and pass the measure. ... During an interview on “Fox & Friends” taped Thursday at the White House and aired Friday, Trump appeared eager to avoid offending any of the holdouts. The president, as he did as a candidate, is not afraid of personally besmirching a political foe — but when it came to Paul, Johnson, Cruz and Lee, Trump had nothing but praise and understanding. “They’re four good guys and they’re friends of mine,” the president said. “We have four very good people, and it’s not that they’re opposed. “They’d like to get certain changes,” he said, “and we’ll see if we can take care of that.” (Bennett, 6/23) Obama Lambastes Repeal Plan: There's A 'Fundamental Meanness At The Core Of This Legislation' Former President Barack Obama spoke out on Facebook against Republicans' efforts to overturn his signature legislation. The Washington Post: ‘Meanness At The Core:’ Obama Jumps Back Into Political Fray To Slam Trump, GOP On Health Care The plan is “not a health care bill,” Obama declared in a 939-word message to his nearly 53 million followers on Facebook. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.” The 44th president did not mention his successor, Donald Trump, but his scathing criticism and urgent tone — imploring his supporters to speak out against the “fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation” — set up a direct public fight with the current White House occupant over the future of the nation’s health care system. (Nakamura, 6/22) Politico: Obama Says Senate Health Care Bill Has 'Fundamental Meanness' Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family — this bill will do you harm,” he added. “And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.” (Conway, 6/22) The Hill: Obama Slams 'Fundamental Meanness' Of Senate Healthcare Bill Obama’s assertion of the bill’s “meanness” echoes remarks from President Trump, who reportedly told GOP senators at a meeting last week that the House measure was “mean” and that the Senate bill should be more generous. (Greenwood, 6/22) Democrats' Reaction: This Bill Is Worse Than Expected In responding to the Senate GOP's health plan, Democrats on both sides of the Capitol were quick to term it a harmful and heartless measure. Politico: Democrats Call Senate Health Bill Even 'Meaner' Than The House Version The minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and nearly 30 of his Democratic colleagues sped to the floor to lambaste the 142-page health care bill that was released less than an hour before by Republicans. They quickly outlined their objections that they had been pushing for weeks: Deep cuts to Medicaid, a lack of protection for pre-existing conditions, tax breaks for the wealthy. “It’s every bit as bad as the House bill. In some ways, it’s even worse,” Schumer said. (Kim and Schor, 6/22) The Washington Post: Pelosi To Trump: Senate Bill Is ‘Mean And Heartless’ House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) denounced the Senate’s health-care bill Thursday as “mean and heartless.” It was a direct challenge to President Trump, who has called the House version “mean” behind closed doors after publicly celebrating its passage. Speaking at a weekly news conference, Pelosi said the bill would cause “millions and millions and millions of people” to lose their health care, “inflict great suffering on veterans, on seniors, on working families, on rural communities” and “clobber the states” by making them unable to fund their Medicaid programs. (Viebeck, 6/22) The Hill: Sanders: Senate ObamaCare Bill 'Worse Than Expected' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday slammed the plan put forth by Senate Republicans to repeal and replace ObamaCare, saying the legislation “is even worse than expected.” “The bill Republicans announced today is even worse than expected and by far the most harmful piece of legislation I have seen in my lifetime,” Sanders said in a statement. (Shelbourne, 6/22) The Oregonian: Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley Decries Senate Health-Care Bill As 'Diabolical,' Points Out Its 'Pregnancy Tax'  For weeks, a small group of Republicans in the U.S. Senate have been secretly crafting health-insurance legislation in response to the House of Representatives bill that President Donald Trump recently called mean. Now the Senate GOP's effort is out in the open: the bill wouldn't repeal the Democrats' controversial 2010 Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) but it would eliminate most of its taxes while arguably softening the House bill's Medicaid cuts and rollback of safeguards for people with preexisting conditions. (Perry, 6/22) Concord (N.H.) Monitor: Shaheen Cites Concord Boy In Response To Senate Health Care Bill Bodhi Bhattarai, who suffers from a rare genetic neuromuscular disease, uses an expensive wheelchair to move around, giving the 3-year-old Concord boy a level of independence his parents once thought he’d never have. Now the couple is worried again, after Senate Republicans unveiled a health care bill Thursday that some fear would strip coverage from those with pre-existing conditions. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen cited this concern on the Senate floor, showing a picture of Bodhi sitting next to his mother. (6/22) Detroit Free Press: Michigan Democrats Attack Senate Republican Health Care Proposal As Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate today revealed a draft of health care legislation they say will stabilize individual insurance markets, Democrats from Michigan and elsewhere attacked it as mean-spirited and stingy, saying it will hurt lower-income families and seniors. “Frankly, we’d like to have a ceremony and light this on fire,” U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said on the Senate floor, waving a copy of the 142-page draft legislation as she argued against the bill, which is intended to repeal and replace the 7-year-old Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. (Spangler, 6/22) Hospital Groups Heap Criticism On GOP's Plan: 'Go Back To The Drawing Board' Health industry groups either came out strongly against the proposed legislation or remained quiet on the day of its release. Stat: Hospital Groups Slam Health Care Bill Released By Senate Hospitals panned the Senate’s latest health reform efforts on Thursday, blasting the chamber’s newly released draft legislation as a draconian and devastating contraction of funds that support health care for low-income Americans and children. Every major hospital association criticized the draft, including the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, and America’s Essential Hospitals. AHA and FAH both called for the Senate to scrap its draft and start over. (Mershon and Blau, 6/22) Bloomberg: Hospital Groups On Senate Health Bill: Go Back To Drawing Board  Hospital trade groups had one message to the small group of Senate Republicans who released their health bill after two months of closed-door meetings: “Go back to the drawing board. ”While U.S. hospital and other health-care stocks rallied Thursday, with a sense of relief that the spending reductions contained in the plan weren’t as deep, or fast, as investors anticipated, the biggest hospital associations in the country lambasted the proposal. The Better Care Reconciliation Act, which would replace Obamacare, puts the health of millions of poor, elderly, disabled and chronically ill patients at risk, said Rick Pollack, chief executive officer of the American Hospital Association. (Mattingly and Lauerman, 6/22) The Hill: Healthcare Groups Issue Scathing Criticism Of Senate Bill  Leading healthcare advocacy groups are urging the Senate to make substantial changes to its healthcare plan released Thursday, warning it could have negative consequences for people across the country. The proposal includes deep cuts to Medicaid and fundamentally reshapes the program from an open-ended government commitment to a system of capped federal payments that limit spending. (Roubein and Hellmann, 6/22) The Washington Post: Republicans’ New Obamacare Repeal Bill Has A Lot For Insurers To Like And For Hospitals To Hate Major health care industry groups largely fell into two camps on Thursday when Republicans released their Affordable Care Act repeal: There were those groups that criticized the bill, and those that preferred to say nothing at all. For the health insurance industry, the bill is a mixed bag. The major trade association for health insurers, America's Health Insurance Plans, declined to issue a specific response to the bill, saying they were still evaluating it. But the proposed legislation contains several provisions that the industry has been fighting for, including a tax repeal worth $145 billion over 10 years to the industry and a guarantee that billions of dollars of federal subsidies would be paid in 2018 and 2019 to stabilize plans in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces before they are phased out. There are also two funds, adding up to $112 billion over a decade, to stabilize the market and make insurance more affordable. (Johnson, 6/22) The Wall Street Journal: Senate Bill Poses Risks To Health-Care Companies Senate Republicans’ health overhaul carries big risks for many health-care companies because of its cutbacks to federal Medicaid funding and the uncertain impact of its broad changes to individual health-insurance markets. The bill contains elements that will immediately be seen as wins for some companies—particularly the repeal of a tax on health-insurance plans and of a levy on medical devices, both of which have been strongly opposed by those businesses. But the proposed changes to Medicaid will be bad news, particularly over the long term, for hospitals and other health-care providers, as well as for insurers that manage Medicaid business, as those funds are curtailed, analysts and industry executives said. (Wilde Mathews and Evans, 6/22) The Wall Street Journal: Big Pharma Plays It Safe On Senate Health Bill The branded-drug industry, which was pilloried by conservatives for supporting then-President Barack Obama’s health-care overhaul, is playing it safe as Republicans move to undo the measure. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association for brand-name drug companies also known as PhRMA, has avoided taking a position on the Republican bill released Thursday.

(Paul, 6/22) Reverberations Of Republicans' Health Bill Felt In States Media outlets report on reactions in California, Texas, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Massachusetts, Kansas and Florida. San Francisco Chronicle: Senate Health Care Bill Called ‘Devastating’ To California Senate Republicans’ health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, released Thursday, would lead to millions of Californians losing health coverage, paying more for insurance or seeing their benefits scaled back, according to health policy experts. The measure would impose steep cuts in the Medi-Cal insurance program that provides benefits to 14 million Californians — nearly a third of the state’s population. (Ho, 6/22) Houston Chronicle: Senate Version Of Health-Care Law Gets Mixed Reviews In Texas  The U.S. Senate's health care plan garnered mixed reviews in Texas on Thursday. Some applauded its sweep, others offered tepid support, and still others voiced outright disgust as they accused the bill of balancing tax cuts on the backs of the state's most vulnerable. The 142-page discussion draft, titled the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 and authored in secret by Senate Republicans, in essence repeats much of the U.S. House bill that narrowly passed last month.

Hours after the bill was made public, four conservative senators announced their opposition, saying the measure doesn't go far enough to unwind Obamacare. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, meanwhile, joined a chorus of centrist Republicans who are concerned about how the legislation would affect their states.

(Cain, 6/22) Georgia Health News: Senate Health Care Bill Debuts In Uncertain Environment Georgia political leaders, including Gov. Nathan Deal, have expressed concern about that conversion, if the federal spending is pegged to the states’ per-enrollee spending. With Georgia ranking 45th among states in Medicaid spending per enrollee, a capped structure would create a disadvantage by locking Georgia in at its historically low spending rate, the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute pointed out in a new study.

"Obama on Senate bill: It’s ‘not a health care bill’"|"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Thursday spoke out against a proposed GOP Senate bill that dismantles the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. “I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,” Obama wrote in a Facebook post. “Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what’s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did.” The GOP-proposed bill would repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of Medicaid, and eliminate Obamacare’s taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others. Senators are likely to have only a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the 142-page bill, which was unveiled on Thursday. In his statement, Obama said the Senate bill is “not a health care bill.” “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” he wrote. “It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Those with private insurance will experience higher premiums and higher deductibles, with lower tax credits to help working families cover the costs, even as their plans might no longer cover pregnancy, mental health care, or expensive prescriptions. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions could become the norm again. Millions of families will lose coverage entirely.” The former President argued that he fought for the ACA “for more than a year” alongside “thousands upon thousands of Americans” because “we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course.” He ended his Facebook post encouraging the public to call members of Congress, visit their offices, speak out and “let them and the country know, in very real terms, what this means for you and your family.” “After all, this debate has always been about something bigger than politics,” he wrote. “It’s about the character of our country — who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that’s always worth fighting for.” The Senate bill is similar to the version of the House measure that passed last month. Trump has since called it “mean,” despite celebrating it at the Rose Garden with House Republicans. Democrats have blasted the Senate bill, with some calling it “meaner.” Four conservative Republican senators — Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee — said they opposed the current version. And key votes such as GOP Sens. Dean Heller and Susan Collins have also withheld support."|"http://q13fox.com/2017/06/22/obama-on-senate-bill-its-not-a-health-care-bill/"|"2017-06-22 12:16:16"
"5 ways Senate Trumpcare is an assault on your freedom"|"And it’s really going to happen… unless we can raise holy hell The Senate GOP released its secret Trumpcare bill on Thursday, ending the most secretive and undemocratic process used to craft a large-scale reform in modern American history. But that’s not the story that really matters now. The story that really matters is this is all a charade. Mitch McConnell sees the 50 votes necessary to pass this thing lining up, or he wouldn’t have released a bill. And all the members of his caucus are merely players in a production designed to give the appearance of a negotiated breakthrough that allows the House to pass the whole thing by July 4. Yes, they want this entire monstrosity to be law in less than two weeks. And this is really going to happen… unless the outrage against this bill becomes the biggest story in America and stays that way until Trumpcare dies. When four conservative Senators quickly came forward to say they opposed the bill in its current form, only one was likely serious — Rand Paul. The other three are seeking slight concessions to buck up the right and giving cover to the four Republican Senators who will actually decide if this plot to immiserate much of America happens: Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia – (202) 224-6472 Lisa Murkowski, Alaska – (202) 224-6665 Dean Heller, Nevada – (202) 224-6244 Susan Collins, Maine – (202) 224-2523 If any of these four represent you, please call them and keep calling until you can’t any more. These are the only four Senators whose concerns about this bill that don’t involve a GOP primary. Conservatives complaints about this legislation give them cover and serve their prime political directive — pretending to be “moderate.” If they represent you, tell them that you’re watching to make sure that they aren’t bought off by a slight concession that will do nothing to change the fundamental design of this crime against freedom. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” President Obama wrote on Facebook. “It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.” Adding a few billion to fight the Opioid crisis or even removing the provisions that attack Planned Parenthood won’t change that. Here’s why: 1. Trumpcare chains you to your job. Job lock, which Obamacare alleviated for many, will be back — big time. We’ll be paying more for worse insurance. And few of us will have the freedom to start a new venture, especially as you age and premiums rise drastically and subsidies drop off a steep cliff. 2. Trumpcare leaves you at risk of a crisis that could easily bankrupt you. Yearly and lifetime caps will be gone for millions of Americans who live in states that will seek waivers. This means if you or your kids need just one serious surgery, you could exhaust your entire coverage in just days. 3. Trumpcare threatens the entire insurance market. Reforming 1/6 of our economy exclusively to benefit rich people in this slapdash manner leaves us with a bill that has all the things Republicans pretended to hate about Obamacare — higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs in general — and a formula for an actual death spiral, leaving tens of millions of us priced out of any decent care. Sure, this could eventually lead to single payer. COULD. EVENTUALLY. But how many people would die in the meantime? 4. Trumpcare gives the wealthy even more control of our politics. This bill gives the richest 400 Americans a $7 million tax break EACH YEAR, largely paid for by cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. This $2.8 billion is a key to Republicans believing they can get away with this massive legistlative heist. That’s about how much money was spent on the entire presidential election and the richest Americans will know exactly whom to thank with generous donations — GOP Senators and Members of Congress in vulnerable seats. 5. Trumpcare dooms anyone who has family or loved ones who may get old, disabled or sick and doesn’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on their care. Take a look at this chart put together by Margot Sanger-Katz: These are the people who’ve depended on Medicaid since 1965, which is why the afflicted suffer greatly in America but kids, the disabled and the elderly are generally not abandoned. Chances are you know at least one person in one of these groups or you actually are one. This law will change your life forever. Medicaid will be strangled — possibly out of existence. Republicans believe that the biggest problem in America is that millionaires who earn investment income have to pay a 3.8% tax on income over $250,000. Trumpcare solves that. In exchange, you can expect to drain your 401k taking care of your sick parents or family members — if you’re ever able to put any money into it at all."|"http://www.eclectablog.com/2017/06/5-ways-senate-trumpcare-is-an-assault-on-your-freedom.html"|"2017-06-22 4:38:01"
"Republican Healthcare Bill Gives Tax Cuts to the Rich by Gutting Safety Net for Poor & Middle Class"|"AMY GOODMAN: After weeks of secret deliberations, Republican senators Thursday released a healthcare bill that would reduce key benefits for millions of Americans. The Better Care Reconciliation Act would fund a large capital gains tax cut for the rich by removing millions of low-income and disabled people from Medicaid. According to the Center on Budget [and] Policy Priorities, $33 billion of the tax cuts would benefit the 400 wealthiest U.S. households. The Senate bill would also reduce subsidies to individuals to purchase health insurance, and would allow states to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The measure would defund Planned Parenthood for a year, making breast cancer screenings and basic reproductive services more difficult for women to secure. While drafting the legislation, President Trump had called on Republicans to improve the House plan by giving it more, quote, “heart.” The bill was negotiated behind closed doors between 13 Republican white male senators. This is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL: We agreed on the need to free Americans from Obamacare’s mandates. And policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandate, so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don’t need or can’t afford; will repeal the employer mandate, so Americans no longer see their hours and take-home pay cut by employers because of it. AMY GOODMAN: Senator McConnell says he wants to vote on the healthcare bill next week, before Congress leaves for the Fourth of July recess. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes for the measure to pass with 50 votes. Four Republican senators—Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee—said Thursday they’ll oppose the bill in its current form, arguing it fails to cut Medicaid benefits enough. The bill is similar to a House measure that would leave more than 20 million Americans without health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to score the Senate bill. Democrats are firmly united against the bill. This is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: This is a bill designed to strip away healthcare benefits and protections from Americans who need it most, in order to give a tax break to the folks who need it least. This is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it, rolling back Medicaid expansion, cutting federal support for the program even more than the House bill, which cut Medicaid by $800 billion. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as scores of disabled protesters held a sit-in outside Senator Mitch McConnell’s office on Capitol Hill Thursday and demonstrators gathered at Washington, D.C.’s National Airport to target Republican lawmakers as they left town for their home states. Also on Thursday, Barack Obama weighed in on efforts to scale back his signature healthcare law. He posted a scathing statement on Facebook that said, quote, “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” President Obama said. For more, we host a roundtable discussion with three guests. Joining us from Boston, John McDonough, professor at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, served as a senior adviser on national health reform to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions from 2008 to 2010. And from 2003 to ’08, he served as executive director of Health Care for All in Massachusetts, playing a key role in passage of the 2006 Massachusetts health reform law. He’s the author of Inside National Health Reform. Also in Boston, Dr. Steffie Woolhandler joins us, a professor at CUNY-Hunter College and a primary care physician. She’s a lecturer at Harvard Medical School and the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. She is a well-known national advocate for Medicare for all. And in Aspen, Colorado, we’re joined by Dr. Willie Parker, physician, abortion provider, and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health. His new book, Life’s Work: A Moral Argument for Choice. We welcome you all back to Democracy Now! Let’s begin with Professor McDonough. Can you lay out what the Republicans presented, after weeks of secret negotiations with other Republicans? JOHN McDONOUGH: So, I think that the statements from Senator Schumer articulated it well. What is essentially going on here is the Affordable Care Act was an attempt to improve the nation’s healthcare system and expand coverage and deal with other issues. And it was paid for significantly by new taxes on wealthy Americans and some very powerful corporate interests. The new bill in the House, and reflected in the Senate, is an attempt to do major tax cuts for wealthy Americans and powerful corporate interests, financed by decimating the Medicaid program and other essential parts of the nation’s healthcare safety net. So, that is clearly what’s going on. The Senate initially said, “We will take the House bill and throw it away and start all over.” Instead, what they’ve done is simply make a number of adjustments. If you look up close between the two, you can see many, many disagreements and differences of opinion on details, but if you stand back, they are essentially the same thing. They fundamentally undermine the nation’s commitment to the Medicaid program, which covers about 75 million low-income and lower-income Americans by phasing out the expansion that was created in the Affordable Care Act and by fundamentally changing the financing of it, where they put a cap on it so that states will have no choice but begin to retrench back on the benefits. They continue the subsidies for private health insurance purchase for lower-middle-income Americans, but, again, they substantially degrade that coverage—for example, lowering the—what’s called the actuarial value, or how much benefit you get out of your premiums, from the ACA standard of 70 percent down to 58 percent, which means higher copays, higher deductibles, across the board. They defund Planned Parenthood for a year, but setting it up then to continue well into the future. They get rid of the Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund that has provided vital public health funds to the Centers for Disease Control as well as public health departments all over the country. You can go on and on. It’s hard to find something in the measure that one could say that’s good or at least not harmful. It’s pretty much bad from start to finish. AMY GOODMAN: On the issue of Medicaid, we’re talking about Medicaid cut, overall, in half, something we haven’t seen in the history of Medicaid, both Medicaid expansion and Medicaid itself. And can you talk about who is covered by Medicaid? Like half the babies born in this country are paid for by Medicaid. JOHN McDONOUGH: Yeah, so, Medicaid is the primary insurance coverage program for low- and lower-income Americans, many children, most children in the United States—more children under Medicaid than any other kind of coverage—their parents, poor senior citizens, low-income disabled people and other working low-income adults, who have no other options for coverage. About a third of the Medicaid program consists of low-income senior citizens and disabled. They actually account for two-thirds of the spending on the program. And so, if you want to take a meat ax, which is what they’re doing, to the Medicaid program, it is really impossible to implement cuts at that level without having damaging impacts on low-income, disabled and elderly, as well as children, parents and families. AMY GOODMAN: Nursing homes? JOHN McDONOUGH: Nursing homes is very much a part of the benefits that low-income seniors get. Very few families have had seniors, grandparents or parents, who have gone into long-term care and not at some point needed help from Medicaid to pay for the cost of long-term care, which is just so unaffordable for most Americans. AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, presumably, you only saw this starting yesterday. This was kept under wraps from many Republicans, as well as Democrats, in the Senate. And it’s interesting, the Republicans who are opposed to this. You have the group, like Mike Lee from Utah and Rand Paul from Kentucky, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, who don’t—who feel that this doesn’t go far enough. But then you also have Senator Susan Collins from Maine, as well as Senator Murkowski from Alaska, who are deeply concerned that this, well, once again, as with the House bill, that apparently President Trump has called “mean,” will mean tens of millions of more Americans will lose their health insurance. DR. STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER: Well, it certainly will. I think it’s very important for people to express their views on this bill to the senators, because there will be a vote next week. You know, it is, of course—this bill, of course, is quite a bit meaner in some ways than the House bill. The cuts to Medicaid, for instance, are much deeper. And many people, like those in nursing homes and poor infants, are going to be affected worse. There’s going to be worse problems under this bill. But I do want to just talk a little bit about how the taxes are—these big tax windfalls are going to come to the rich. What the Republican bill does is says that rich people who get their income from investments no longer have to pay the Medicare tax. People who earn in wages and salaries have to pay a 3 to 4 percent Medicare tax. But the Republican Senate and House bills will say that rich people earning $100 million a year off of investments, through stock sales and dividends, no longer have to pay that same Medicare tax that the rest of us pay. They’ve been very quiet about that, because I don’t think that’s a very popular idea. You know, additionally, they’re cutting taxes on the insurance industry, on Pharma, as if they needed more money. They’re cutting taxes on the medical device industry. So this is a giant tax cut, a very unpopular tax cut, if Americans really understood who was getting this tax windfall. And it’s going to make healthcare skimpier and more expensive for ordinary Americans. AMY GOODMAN: Professor John McDonough, does this void Obamacare altogether, if this were passed? JOHN McDONOUGH: If it were passed in its current form, it would do unprecedented damage to that law, most of the major portions of it that deal with expanding coverage and providing some security for Americans in terms of needing healthcare services. There are other major parts of the law that it actually doesn’t touch at all. There’s a big part of the law that’s trying to do major changes in medical care delivery, creating new mechanisms called accountable care organizations, establishing a center for innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. None of those are touched, so there’s large parts of the law that, quietly, Republicans actually support and seem to want to continue and even expand. But the major pieces of the law, in terms of expanding insurance coverage for low- and lower-middle-income Americans and the taxes to pay for that, are pretty well decimated in terms of what’s on the table right now. And this is going to move very fast. It’s possible that it won’t happen. And that’s why Steffie is so correct when she says everybody’s got to weigh in here. But if they succeed in getting it through the Senate on Thursday or Friday of next week, there are some reports that the House may actually convene on Saturday and adopt the Senate version and send it to the president’s desk. So this could move with unprecedented rapidity for such a major controversial issue. So the stakes are very high. And the place really where this needs to get stalled and defeated is next week in the Senate. AMY GOODMAN: So are you saying that this actually could go to the House—instead of the House attempting to reconcile the Senate and House bills, they could just adopt the Senate bill? JOHN McDONOUGH: It is conceivable that, you know, if it gets through the Senate with 50 votes, that the Senate will say to the House, “This is it, folks. Take it or leave it.” And they will come on Saturday, and they may be able to string together enough votes so that they could actually just adopt the Senate plan in toto and send it directly to President Trump’s desk. AMY GOODMAN: You were one of— JOHN McDONOUGH: So, this could happen very fast. AMY GOODMAN: You were one of the architects of Romneycare in Massachusetts, right? JOHN McDONOUGH: We didn’t call it that. AMY GOODMAN: Well, the Affordable Care Act very much based on a Republican plan, under a Republican governor of Massachusetts, Governor Romney, who would later, obviously, run for president. How far away are the Republicans today in Congress, in the House and the Senate, from that Republican plan in Massachusetts that did get passed? JOHN McDONOUGH: Well, there’s a—there’s a significant withdrawal. As we know, the individual mandate was a Republican conservative idea, going back to the 1980s. The ’90s, that was their alternative to Bill Clinton’s universal coverage plan. And they continued to promote it throughout the process where we passed it in Massachusetts. And then, when it got to Congress in 2009 and it was Barack Obama who was supporting it, then they all jumped off the ship and left the Democrats there by ourselves to try to get as best done as it was possible to get done at that time. So, there’s been a substantial retrenchment. And what’s left is—I saw, you know, this morning, on one of the TV shows, Senator Rand Paul basically saying, “Well, I think we should just take away all of the standards and requirements and let people buy whatever they want. And people should be able to buy health insurance,” he said, “for about a dollar a day”—so, about $365 a year. I don’t know what that would really get you, but it wouldn’t get you very much. But I think that one has to understand is what motivates the Republican Party is cutting taxes. That’s first, and everything else is secondary to that goal, whether it’s healthcare, education, environmental protection—everything else. So this is part of a bigger pattern in terms of the Republican agenda. It’s just this is so big and important, this is up first. But this is not the end. This is just the beginning. AMY GOODMAN: John McDonough, I know you have to leave. I want to thank you for being with us, professor at Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Steffie Woolhandler will stay with us. And we’ll be joined by Dr. Willie Parker, who’s chair of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health. He is an abortion provider himself. And we’ll talk specifically about what this bill will do to Planned Parenthood.

"GOP Health Care Plan: Massive Wealth Transfer to Corporations, Military, and the Rich"|"transcriptJAISAL NOOR: Despite growing opposition and protests, Donald Trump continues to push the House GOP healthcare plan, or Trumpcare. DONALD TRUMP: We're also working closely with the House and Senate Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House plan will expand choice, lower costs, and ensure healthcare access for all. JAISAL NOOR: Even as the non-partisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded 24 million Americans would lose healthcare over the next decade, under a Republican plan to dismantle Obamacare. Trump administration officials disagreed with the findings, even as a leaked secret White House analysis puts that number even higher. As many as 26 million could lose their healthcare, according to internal White House documents, obtained by Politico. MAN: We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out. We believe that our plan will cover more individuals, at a lower cost, and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not that the government forces them to buy. JAISAL NOOR: The CBO did find the Republican plan would save taxpayers $377 billion, but as the Intercept reports, that savings would be absorbed into Trump's massive military spending increase. DONALD TRUMP: We're also going to send Congress a budget request that will include one of the largest increases to defense spending in our history, and General-slash-Secretary Mattis is extremely upset about that. AUDIENCE: (laughter) DONALD TRUMP: And it will be fully paid for. Okay? Fully paid for. JAISAL NOOR: Fourteen million Americans would lose medical insurance by next year under a Republican plan to dismantle Obamacare. The non-partisan U.S. Congressionally Budget Office said on Monday, in a report that dealt a setback to President Donald Trump's first major legislative initiative. The House GOP bill would also hurt low and middle income families, by cutting federal Medicaid spending by $880 billion, ending the ACA's Medicaid expansion, and cutting subsidies. For example, average premiums would rise 20% to 25% for 64-year-olds. Meanwhile, the rich benefit. Including a $50,000 tax cut to millionaires, $7 million in tax breaks to the wealthiest households, while enriching the drug and insurance industries, according to analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. House of Representatives Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi, quickly condemned the Republican healthcare plan, following the CBO report. NANCY PELOSI: The CBO has reported that the Republican bill pushes 24 million people out of healthcare, off of health coverage. This is a remarkable figure. It speaks so eloquently to the cruelty of the bill that the Speaker calls, an act of mercy. I don't know if he thinks it's an act of mercy to all the people who will lose coverage, to people who will lose jobs, to the hospitals that they have to close down, especially in rural areas. JAISAL NOOR: Obamacare enabled about 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical insurance. But some, like Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a professor, physician and co-founder of Physicians for a National Healthcare Program, say Democrats blundered by not endorsing universal healthcare. Dr. STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER: And of course, the big mistake the Democrats made, was by saying that they were going to defend the status quo, and pretending that Obamacare had solved the problem, when it really hadn't. It helped a little bit, but it had not solved the problem. And the American people, three years into the full implementation of Obamacare, at the end of 2016, said that's not true. You have not solved the problems. We have these problems, and President Trump made it look like that was the fault of the Obamacare legislation. What the Democrats needed to be saying then, and need to be saying now is, we are moving forward from Obamacare, to truly universal care, to a single payer plan. That would have energized the electorate. That would've really provided something for white working class people, and it would've helped prevent this very disastrous swing of white working class families into the Trump... the ranks of Trump voters.

The Democratic presidential nominee's Twitter account shared a study Friday afternoon from a progressive think tank, the Center for American Progress, predicting that the Senate bill could lead to between 18,000 and 27,000 additional deaths in 2026 if those people have no coverage. Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party, she tweeted. Death panels is a reference to a line of attack that that was used by some Republicans amid debate on the Affordable Care Act in 2009, suggesting that Obamacare would have the government determine whether elderly people or people with special needs deserve care. The discussion surrounded a provision that would have used Medicare funds to pay for doctors to discuss end-of-life options with patients -- but that proposal did not end up becoming part of the ACA. This is Clinton's fourth tweet about health care since the Senate bill was released Thursday morning. She encouraged people to call their senators about Trumpcare, and she retweeted a former adviser to her campaign who shared a graphic showing possible effects of proposed Medicaid cuts on children. Earlier Friday, her Twitter account shared a Facebook post from former President Barack Obama denouncing the bill. So far, Republicans in the Senate have expressed some reservations with the bill, and most of them are still reviewng the text, according to CNN's whip count. But several have pointed out that the Republican bill improves on Obamacare, which they say was a large-government approach to health care that does not deliver the benefits it promised for patients. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said: After reviewing the initial working draft, I believe it includes many substantial fixes to our broken health care system...Obviously, this will not be the final bill, but I'm hopeful that we can resolve the remaining disagreements and deliver a consensus bill that is a vast improvement over Obamacare. Former Vice President Joe Biden also tweeted criticism of the Senate measure. The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all -- it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy & corporations. His tweet echoed Obama's message the day before: The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill, Obama's Facebook post read. It's a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

""|"Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a sweeping measure to roll back the Affordable Care Act, dramatically reducing government spending and in a way that could leave millions more Americans without health insurance. The plan, released by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his team after working on it largely behind closed doors in recent weeks, would hit California particularly hard, in large part because the Senate bill proposes deep long-term cuts to Medicaid, called Medi-Cal in this state. About 14 million Californians — more than a third of the Golden State’s residents — are covered under the health care program for low-income and disabled residents, including about four million who were added since 2014 through a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allowed adults without dependent children to enroll. Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, said the bill’s “draconian cuts” to Medicaid would be widely felt, affecting not only “half of our children, and two-thirds of our seniors in nursing homes, but the health system on which we all rely.” Wright said the Senate bill would spike premiums and deductibles for many middle-class families who are covered by plans under Covered California, the state’s health care insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called “Obamacare.” The Senate bill is similar to the House health care bill that passed last month. Like the House bill, the Senate version would repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate and severely cut back on federal support of Medicaid, as well as eliminate Obamacare’s taxes on the wealthy and insurers. Both the Senate and House plans would keep Obamacare’s subsidies to help people pay for individual coverage — but they wouldn’t be as generous as those under the Affordable Care Act. California has long championed Obamacare and its success in slicing the number of uninsured Californians by more than one-half. And many problems that have popped up on other state health insurance exchanges around the country — soaring premiums and health insurers dropping out of the marketplace — just haven’t happened here. Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, underscored in a tweet Thursday the bleak future that he believes lies ahead for many of the state’s residents. “While it appears that the Senate bill largely adopts the marketplace and subsidy structure of the Affordable Care Act, in many ways we could be returning to the days when consumers who thought they were covered found the rug pulled out from underneath them when they tried to get health care,” Lee wrote. Advertisement Jonathan Greer, a spokesman at the Golden Gate Association of Health Underwriters, agreed, saying fewer middle-income Californians would be eligible for health insurance subsidies since the bill lowers the maximum income level for receiving a subsidy. “In a high-cost state like California, that’s a big problem,” Greer said. For example, he said a family of three earning $75,000 a year is currently eligible for subsidies but wouldn’t be under the new bill. In the Bay Area, an unsubsidized plan offering benefits such as low-cost prescription drugs can cost more than $1,000 per month, he said. Greer pointed to a bit of good news for lower-income Californians in the Senate’s version: Unlike the House bill that proposed age-based subsidies, the Senate bill retains Obamacare’s income-based premium subsidies that millions rely on to make health insurance more affordable. But it’s the dramatic cuts in federal funding to Medicaid that would hit states the hardest and force them to make deep cuts in the program. That hit home with Gov. Jerry Brown, who pulled no punches Thursday in his assessment of the Senate plan. “Trumpcare 2.0 has the same stench — and effect — as the bill House Republicans and the White House slapped together last month: Millions will lose health care coverage, while millionaires profit,” Brown said in a statement. “The American people deserve better.” Former President Barack Obama, who has eschewed speaking up on political issues since leaving office in January, wrote Thursday on his Facebook page that the Senate proposal showed a “fundamental meanness” that would hurt the elderly and sick. “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,” Obama wrote. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.” Trump tweeted his support of the bill Thursday. “I am very supportive of the Senate #HealthcareBill. Look forward to making it really special! Remember, ObamaCare is dead,” he wrote. Last month in the Rose Garden, Trump praised the House after it passed its own health care replacement bill, calling it “a great plan.” But last week, Trump changed his tune, according to Republican senators, who said Trump told them that the House bill was “mean” and he hoped the Senate would improve the legislation. Some Bay Area health policy experts were supportive of the Senate plan. They included Lanhee Chen, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution who has long supported replacing Obamacare. He called the Senate bill “an improvement” over the House version. “For states that want to experiment with their own health solutions, the bill will provide greater flexibility and an opportunity to generate reforms that work best for their own citizens,” said Chen, a former top adviser to GOP presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio. Fellow Bay Area GOP health care adviser Sally Pipes was not as pleased with the Senate’s proposal. “It is worse than I imagined — I think it will keep Obamacare in place forever if it passes the Senate,” said Pipes, the president and CEO of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute, a nonprofit that promotes limited government. For example, Pipes noted that the Senate bill keeps the Medicaid expansion in place for three more years and then a three-year phaseout, which she said “means the expansion will never end.” The proposed bill is the first concrete display of what the Senate GOP conference will have to work with to overhaul the nation’s health care system. But there’s not much time: With McConnell pushing for a vote next week, senators have just a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the bill. By keeping the details tightly under wraps until Thursday, McConnell and his colleagues seemed to be hoping they could win over their colleagues, while keeping the horse-trading out of the public spotlight. In the process, however, their secrecy angered Democrats while aggravating a number of Republicans, too. The vote required for the bill’s passage will be tight: McConnell can afford to lose only two Republican votes.

"Should the Justice Department terminate the Mueller probe?"|"Republicans powered their Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan through two committees Thursday, maintaining unity — at least for now — as President Trump rebuked naysayers and said the ugly health care debate will end with a “beautiful picture.” The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved its half of the plan after 27 hours of debate in which Democrats used procedural tricks to stall debate and made ill-fated attempts to preserve key parts of Obamacare. Republicans swatted away their amendments, leaving the Republican effort intact after the House tax-writing committee cleared its piece of the puzzle. “We’re delivering for President Trump on his health care plan,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Texas Republican. SEE ALSO: Nancy Pelosi: House Democrats unified in opposition to GOP health care bill The House Budget Committee plans to meet Wednesday to begin fusing the twin bills into legislation that uses arcane budget rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, assuming it gets there. A number of House conservatives have complained that the plan creates another entitlement and “individual mandate” through insurers while allowing states that expanded Medicaid to tap federal coffers for too long, so significant changes might be needed to win their support. Leaders can go only so far, however, before scaring off Republican centrists who are wary of unwinding benefits that took root under the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump, the negotiator in chief, said it will all work out. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” he said on Twitter. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders cannot afford to lose more than 21 Republican votes in the House or more than two in the Senate. They won’t get any help from Democrats, who say the plan will force poorer Americans to pay more for skimpier coverage. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, rolled up his sleeves and pitched the plan to reporters, TED Talk-style, in a bid to earn better coverage of an effort that has been panned by hospital associations and influential groups such as the AARP for seniors and the free market Club for Growth. The plan replaces Obamacare’s income-based subsidies with age-based, refundable tax credits for people who buy insurance on their own, while gradually unwinding President Obama’s expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor. The Republican Study Committee, a bloc of roughly 170 conservatives, said it formally supported a proposal by Rep. Joe Barton, Texas Republican, to freeze Medicaid enrollment under Obamacare’s generous funding rates at the end of this year rather than letting states herd more people into their expanded programs until 2020. It also endorsed a proposal by Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, Virginia Republican, to institute work requirements for able-bodied, childless adults on Medicaid. “While I continue to have concerns about this bill, the adoption of these amendments would be a critical step in the right direction,” said Rep. Mark Walker, North Carolina Republican and RSC chairman. Though the White House and party leaders said they were open to tweaks, Mr. Ryan pushed against conservatives who say they will refuse to back a bill that falls short of everything they want. “This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here. The time is now,” he said. “This is the moment, and this is the closest this will ever happen. It really comes down to a binary choice.” He promised that those with pre-existing conditions won’t lose their coverage, and young people will still be allowed to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 — both popular parts of Obamacare. But he said Medicaid must be reeled in and returned to the states so they can figure out better ways to manage the program and control its costs. He said drafters had to stick to tight rules on the first piece of a three-pronged plan to meet strict budget rules on the Senate side but that other ideas, such as letting insurers sell their plans across state lines, can be part of the future bills. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, rejected the Republicans’ opening bid, saying there wasn’t anything redeeming in it. She said it violated every goal of Obamacare: lower costs, better benefits and expanded numbers of people covered. Mrs. Pelosi said it would be Mr. Trump’s voters who suffer under the Republican bill and called it a massive “transfer of wealth” from red states to blue states. She said poor Republicans would lose coverage while rich people in Democratic states would receive tax cuts with the repeal of Obamacare. “Sadly, the people who will lose care if the Republican plan were to prevail, which I doubt it will, are people who voted for Donald Trump, many of them,” she said. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican whose red state leveraged Obamacare dollars to help an influx of would-be Medicaid enrollees buy private plans instead, emerged as a vocal critic of the House effort, saying the votes didn’t add up on his side of the Capitol. “House health care bill can’t pass Senate w/o major changes. To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don’t get it fast,” he said on Twitter, chastising the House for racing ahead without Congressional Budget Office estimates on the plan’s economic effects and how many people would be covered. The Trump administration said it would like to hear the senator’s ideas for reform. “We’re not jamming this down people’s throat,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. “Sen. Cotton clearly recognizes that the current version of health care that is out there right now is not sustainable. We continue to welcome his input on this. We’re going to let the process work its will,” Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence plan to travel around the country in states with wavering lawmakers to push for passage of the House plan. The president also met with conservative leaders at the White House on Wednesday night and persuaded them to at least hold their fire against the legislation, which some critics have dubbed “Trumpcare” or “Ryancare.” “I don’t care what it’s called,” Mr. Brady said. “I just want to give Americans affordable health care that they choose, not Washington.” • Dave Boyer and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

"FBI chief firing ramps up outrage at 10th Vigil for Democracy"|"  May 10, 2017 – ground zero plus one on push comes to shove about exactly what constitutes patriotism 228 years after America’s Constitution was ratified. Photos/Roger Bianchini One day after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, initially according to Trump spokes-people from Sean Spicer to Kelly Anne Conway to Vice President Michael Pence, because “he done poor Hillary wrong” some six months earlier; and six days after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved the Trump-Paul Ryan health care plan, Len Sherp held his tenth weekly Vigil for Democracy on May 10, 2017. And that May 9 firing of the man at the head of the FBI investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election just added fuel to the fire of the 20 or so anti-Trump demonstrators on the scene.  Those demonstrators were already angry at House Republicans’ May 4 passage of “Trumpcare” (aka the American Health Care Act). Covering ALL the bases, vigil organizer Len Sherp, left, gets some assistance on primary issues at 10th weekly Vigil for Democracy. Initial reports on the AHCA indicate than rather than fix the flaws in ACA coverage, it will not only defund or divert billions of dollars from existing coverage into state slush funds with no guarantees that money will ever be spent on the health care of Americans; but also drop an estimated 24 million Americans from existing, lower cost national health care coverage. Some who have actually read the bill report that contrary to assertions by some Republicans, the Trump-Ryan plan would remove the ACA’s pre-existing condition protections.  It is even said to add some things, from “irregular periods” to the “consequences of rape” to a pending list of pre-existing conditions that health care companies could use to disqualify women from eligibility. So, it was perhaps not surprising to see vigil signs reading: Health Care was one of two main thrusts at the 10th weekly Vigil for Democracy in Front Royal, Virginia. Trumpcare is a GOP war on the poor; Trumpcare: NOT better; NOT cheaper; NOT easier – Believe me; Greed Trumps Health Care; … next to a few nods to the vote our own Sixth District Congressman Bob Goodlatte said he was “thrilled” to cast for the Trump-Ryan plan: Repeal and Replace Goodlatte; Goodlatte “thrilled” to take away your health care; … to a broader indictment of the Party now in control of all three branches of the federal government – “Kill grandma; Have a beer: just another perfect day in the Republican Party” Some are asking exactly what the Trump administration and House Republicans have put forward to improve affordable health care for average Americans. About the FBI … Then there were the protests against Comey’s firing just as the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russian ties was picking up steam, with then Director Comey becoming increasingly involved.  That involvement reportedly included daily briefings, rather than the weekly the director had previously been getting; as well as Comey’s just-submitted request to Congress for additional resources for his agency’s investigation into potential criminal activity by Trump associates interacting with Russian operatives on Trump’s behalf in the 2016 election.  So, next to the health care signs were those reading: Russian influence, and possible interest, in seeing Donald Trump elected president of the United States has been on some minds – see you later, James Comey … Investigate Russian collusion; Investigate Trump’s Russian connections; Independent counsel NOW; and I am here because Trump is a dangerous man. And if there was distress at the perceived danger vigil participants believe Trump and at least some of his Republican allies in Congress present to the checks and balances of the American system of government and its federal law enforcement apparatus, that distress appeared balanced in equal measure by a sense of outrage. That outrage can only have been accentuated the day after vigil number 10 when Trump contradicted his staffs’ earlier explanations for the Comey firing, admitting explosively to NBC’s Lester Holtz that the Comey firing was his decision based at least in part on his outrage that the FBI’s Russia-Trump campaign investigation was continuing – and among other things, that Trump perceived Comey to be “a showboat”. Spit it out, Mr. President – why was Comey really fired? I have hired a “really tremendous” law firm to tell the attorney general I have NO financial interests in Russia … Hence the lone “Independent counsel NOW” sign present on May 10 is likely to see similarly-toned companions at coming vigils.  In fact, with our congressional representative chairing the House Judiciary Committee that very topic was raised in the hours before the vigil’s noon start at the weekly Sixth District “Open Door” meeting hosted by a Goodlatte staffer at Samuels Public Library (see related story soon to be posted). But if distress, anxiety and outrage were at the forefront of the May 10 Vigil for Democracy in Historic Downtown Front Royal, we again saw an indication of the positive movement we have been tracking over the past three weeks there.  The conversation that began last week between Trump supporters Ralph and Michael Waller who have been stationed across Chester Street with their “Trump-Pence” sign, and several vigil participants continued in good spirits on May 10. Trump supporter Ralph Waller, left, and not-supporter Bob Hill are still good, and picked up their conversation on where the two sides might have common ground for a second week. In fact, one of those vigil participants we pictured talking with the Wallers last week, Bob Hill, spent at least the first 40 minutes of the noon to 1 p.m. demonstration across the street on that Trump-enclave bench in front of the Waller’s pawn shop.  At 12:40 p.m. Hill and the Wallers were continuing the conversation seeking common ground between the two sides that began on May 3. As the May 10 vigil was beginning, the Wallers and Hill confirmed that initial common ground found the previous week revolved around a mutual concern for the environment, particularly here in the shadow of the Shenandoah, with the health of our rivers. After a good half hour on the ‘other side of the street’, Bob Hill appears to be offering Michael Waller help with his Trump-Pence campaign sign – but could there have been an ulterior motive? Stay tuned for further episodes of “the conversation starts here in River City” …"|"https://royalexaminer.com/2017/05/15/fbi-chief-firing-ramps-outrage-10th-vigil-democracy/"|"2017-05-15 06:12:30"

"This Week In Garbageville: Tapes Or No Tapes? That Is The Question"|"Another week, another deluge of terrible news and terribler policy in the Trump era. Welcome to our regular feature about which stories are actually worth paying attention to. It's Garbageville, Jake. The incredible shrinking White House briefing Rumors about the looming ouster of White House press secretary Sean Spicer have been stirring ever since his first bout of flop sweat. This week, the beleaguered Spicer confirmed that Trump has forced him to search for his own replacement, and that no one is interested in the job — perhaps because the job itself has become something of an afterthought. For the second week in a row, the White House has declared that the once-televised briefing will no longer be broadcast, and it veiled information about the briefing from public consumption. Should I be paying attention to this? No. The consternation of the press corps is bracing, sure. It's always good to hear journalists bitch about creeping authoritarianism! And a public briefing is an important symbol of accountability and transparency. But the truth is that the most important stories of the Trump era (indeed, of most White House administrations) are not broken from inside the White House. The New York Times' Trump whisperer, Maggie Haberman, doesn't even live in D.C. Stories about Trump's obstructionism have thus far been broken primarily by national security reporters. This leaky White House will have trouble stemming negative coverage no matter how many events they take off-camera — something our reality TV president may not quite understand. Trump asked intel chiefs to weigh in on the Russia investigation According to a Thursday CNN report, Trump not only pressured FBI chief James Comey to end the probe into General Michael Flynn's Russia connections, but also asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers to publicly disavow any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. In a closed Senate testimony, the two intelligence community chiefs described their interactions with the president about the Russia investigation as odd and uncomfortable, but said they did not believe the president gave them orders to interfere, according to multiple sources familiar with their accounts. Coats and Rogers gave more elusive testimony in public hearings earlier this month, reportedly because they had asked the White House for guidance as to whether the conversations were protected under executive privilege, and the White House did not supply that guidance prior to their testimony. Should I be paying attention to this? Take note, sure. It's part of the background music to the investigation of Trump obstructing justice — and background music is important in an obstruction investigation, as it gives context to the investigation target's motivations. So while Coats and Rogers say they did not feel pressured, Trump's behavior does show that he was exasperated by the Russia investigation and willing to take unusual and aggressive steps to move it out of the public eye. The rich man's tax cut, in disguise The Senate’s health care bill finally emerged from its secret drafting process and was made public on Thursday. The so-called Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 reads like a political suicide note, promising to do things that are sure to make an already unpopular Obamacare repeal process absolutely toxic, such as make increasingly severe cuts to Medicaid that would disproportionately affect the poor and elderly. In other words, while this act would continue the health care system’s disproportionate cruelty toward women and communities of color if enacted, it would also hit the so-called white working class. Former President Barack Obama was right when he condemned the bill in a Facebook post. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill, he wrote. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America. Four GOP senators — Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — also registered their opposition to the bill shortly after its publication, but let’s see if they actually vote against it. On that note, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell isn’t sure if the bill has the 50 votes necessary to pass yet, but he is trying to rush that vote to happen before July 4, when the Senate leaves for a recess. Senators usually have town halls during this time, but no Republicans have any scheduled at the moment. Whether Republicans even expect to face accountability from their voters after writing this bill therefore remains an open question. Should I be paying attention to this? Undoubtedly. It’s worth noting that the Senate bill preserves the Obamacare provision that allows people to remain on their parental health insurance until the age of 26. But young people are generally the folks who get pregnant in this world. If you’re poor and need an abortion in a Trumpcare America, you might be in trouble. There’s plenty of culture candy in the bill for Republicans and their voters, including a defunding of Planned Parenthood for one year. The 13 white men in the Senate who crafted the bill are surely excited about that. (It’s also worth keeping in mind that passing the bill through reconciliation means the bill's provisions have to be primarily budgetary in nature, something that may jeopardize the Republican plan to pass the bill with a simple majority of their 52 senators. Cutting off all federal funding for a health provider that has broken no laws in the course of providing reproductive care to millions of women and men is hardly a fiscal priority.) Medicaid also helps a lot of pregnant women, but they aren't the only young people affected by the prospect of severe cuts. Children in special education programs, the disabled, and those struggling with opioid addiction will also suffer. Also, the bill’s headlining act — Medicaid cuts — are severe, but gradual. Assuming a Democratic fix to a Republican health care bill won’t come until they eventually regain power, young voters need to understand that this is an attack on a system upon which they’ll eventually depend. We’ll find out just how many Americans would be kicked off their health insurance plans by the Senate bill once the Congressional Budget Office issues its evaluation next week. Twenty-three million people would be uninsured by 2026 as a result of the House bill that passed in May (and there’s little reason to believe that the Senate bill will have more “heart,” as Trump recently requested). The oldest millennials will be in sight of 50 by the time that happens. It will be curious to see whether the president supports a bill that would violate his most essential promises on health care — including cutting billions from Medicaid, which he said that he wouldn't touch. But aside from the legislation itself, we should also be alarmed by McConnell’s willingness to pervert the typical legislative process, and his success in doing so. Republicans hid this bill from Americans not to avoid having it bartered through the press, but because they are trying to hide a fundamental agenda that predates Trumpism: the elimination of programs for the poor to pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy. Republicans not only want to fundamentally remake American society in their own image, but are also willing to corrupt small-d democratic norms to do it. If that’s OK with you, stay silent. Tapes or no tapes? Days after firing FBI director James Comey in early May, the president of the United States threatened him on Twitter. “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” exclaimed @realDonaldTrump. It was always pretty clear that Trump’s threat was an empty one meant to intimidate Comey — yet it had the opposite effect, encouraging the former director to tell the New York Times about the private memos he wrote about the president’s efforts to influence him and obstruct the investigation into Michael Flynn. In turn, those memos appear to have provoked the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in our elections and any connections to the Trump campaign. In that respect, it’s probably the stupidest and most important tweet that Donald Trump has ever published. Ever since he wrote it, the president, his administration, and his party have kept the drama going about these supposed tapes by continuing to promise to respond to the question of their existence once and for all. On Thursday, Trump ended the suspense, naturally, with two tweets. Should I be paying attention to this? That’s a big question. Trump is rash and impulsive, so it’s unwise to subscribe to the “Trump did X to distract from the real story, which is Y” theory. But the timing of these tweets — hours after the phenomenally unpopular Senate health care bill was publicly published for the first time — seems convenient. Also, Thursday's tweets begged the question of why Trump sent that Comey better hope tweet at all. The president answered that question in a Friday morning interview on his favorite news show, Fox & Friends, in which he copped to using the tweet to influence Comey's testimony. When he found out that there may be tapes out there — whether it’s governmental tapes or anything else, and who knows — I think his story may have changed,” said Trump to interviewer Ainsley Earhardt. “You’ll have to take a look at that because then he has to tell what actually took place at the events. And my story didn’t change — my story was always a straight story, my story always was the truth. But you’ll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed, but I did not tape.” Since Fox News is our de facto state media now, Earhardt then complimented the president on his attempt at scaring Comey into changing his story. It wasn’t very stupid, I can tell you that, he replied. Another interesting aspect about his “admission,” if you can call it that, is that the president of the United States is implying that someone may have taped his conversations with Comey without his knowledge. That seems like a rather massive implication. Optimally, the American public wouldn't see its president squander whatever credibility he has with a steady flow of misleading and false statements. We're well past the point of being able to believe a word that Trump says. It'll be up to investigators, preferably independent ones, to ascertain whether he's lying about the existence of the tapes. But that this all led him to a bold-faced admission of witness intimidation is surely something that is worthy of note. Particularly to the president's attorneys."|"http://www.mtv.com/news/3022317/this-week-in-garbageville-tapes-or-no-tapes-that-is-the-question/"|"2017-06-23 12:58:1"
