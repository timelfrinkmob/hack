1,,Thomas Page,23/06/2017,DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient Egyptians,"Ancient Egyptians and their modern counterparts share less in common than you might think. That is, at least genetically, a team of scientists have found. Researchers from the University of Tuebingen and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, both in Germany, have decoded the genome of ancient Egyptians for the first time, with unexpected results. Publishing its findings in Nature Communications, the study concluded that preserved remains found in Abusir-el Meleq, Middle Egypt, were closest genetic relatives of Neolithic and Bronze Age populations from the Near East, Anatolia and Eastern Mediterranean Europeans. Modern Egyptians, by comparison, share much more DNA with sub-Saharan populations. The findings have turned years of theory on its head, causing Egyptologists to re-evaluate the region's history while unlocking new tools for scientists working in the field.Correcting past errorsDepending on which way you see it, ancient Egyptians have the privilege or ignominy of being one of the most investigated peoples of antiquity. Scientists havevirtually undressedmummies,diagnosedfrom beyond the grave, and exposedmiscarriagesand3,000-year-old scams. Extracting genome data is a new frontier for Egyptologists, however. Scientists took 166 bone samples from 151 mummies, dating from approximately 1400 B.C. to A.D. 400, extracting DNA from 90 individuals and mapping the full genome in three cases.A scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History looks at a jaw bone. Bone, soft tissue and teeth were all studied as part of the research.Previous DNA analysis of mummies has been treated with a necessary dose of skepticism, explains professor Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute. ""When you touch a bone, you probably leave more DNA on the bone than is inside (it),"" he argued. ""Contamination is a big issue. ... Only in the last five or six years has it become possible to actually study DNA from ancient humans, because we can now show whether DNA is ancient or not by (its) chemical properties."" Heat and high humidity in tombs, paired with some of the chemicals involved in mummification, all contribute to DNA degradation, the paper adds, but it describes its findings as ""the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians."" Analyzing samples spanning over a millennium, researchers looked for genetic differences compared with Egyptians today. They found that the sample set showed a strong connection with a cluster of ancient non-African populations based east of the Mediterranean Sea. Krause describes the far-reaching data set gained from looking at mitochondrial genomes: ""This is not just the DNA of one person. It's the DNA of the parents, grandparents, grandparents' parents, grand-grand-grandparents' parents and so forth. ""So if we don't find sub-Saharan African ancestry in those people, that is pretty representative, at least for Middle Egypt."" Krause hypothesizes that ancient Northern Egypt would be much the same, if not more, linked to the Near East. Ancient Southern Egypt might be a different matter, however, where populations lived closer to Nubia, home of the ""Black Pharaohs"" in what is now Sudan. ""The genetics of the Abusir el-Meleq community did not undergo any major shifts during the 1,300-year timespan we studied,"" said Wolfgang Haak, group leader at the Max Planck Institute. This period covered the rule of Alexander the Great (332-323 B.C.), the Ptolemaic dynasty (323-30 B.C.) and part of Roman rule (30 B.C.-A.D. 641). Strict social structures and legal incentives to marry along ethnic lines within these communities may have played a part in the Egyptians' genetic stasis, the paper speculates. ""A lot of people has assumed foreign invaders ... brought a lot of genetic ancestry into the region,"" Krause said. ""People expected that through time, Egypt would become more European, but we see the exact opposite."" Modern Egyptians were found to ""inherit 8% more ancestry from African ancestors"" than the mummies studied. The paper cites increased mobility along the Nile, increased long-distance commerce and the era of the trans-Saharan slave trade as potential reasons why. The team's findings do come with one obvious caveat: ""All our genetic data (was) obtained from a single site in Middle Egypt and may not be representative for all of ancient Egypt,"" the paper concedes. While the study might be limited in scope, the team believes it has made some technical breakthroughs. ""I expect there will be a ton of ancient Egyptian mummy genomes (mapped) in the next couple of years,"" Krause said, adding that ""multiple groups"" are following his team's lead. ""There's always more research we can do. This is not the end. It's just the beginning.""",english,24/06/2017 12:10,http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/22/health/ancient-egypt-mummy-dna-genome-heritage/index.html,US,103,DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient Egyptians,0,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170620174237-ancient-egypt-mummy-dna-genome-data-exlarge-169.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,health
2,,Erik Ortiz,24/06/2017,"Thunderbird F-16 Military Jet Flips Over at Dayton, Ohio, Air Show Practice","A fighter jet from the famed U.S. Air Force group the Thunderbirds ran off the runway after landing and flipped over at a Dayton airfield as the team practiced for an air show, officials said. The pilot suffered injuries that are not life-threatening. The U.S. Air Force said the F-16 Fighting Falcon was involved in a ""mishap"" upon landing at about 12:20 p.m. ET. Dayton officials said two people were on board the plane. Lt. Col. Jason Heard, commander of the Thunderbirds, said at a news conference that the pilot, Capt. Erik Gonsalves, suffered lacerations to his head as well as a leg injury. Sgt. Kenneth Cordova did not have visible injuries, Heard said. Both were conscious and talking when they were extracted from the 25,000-pound plane and taken to the hospital. Gonsalves and Cordova had approximately 1,600 hours of flight experience. A safety board will investigate and determine the cause of the mishap. The Wright Patterson Air Force Base said its firefighters responded alongside the airport's fire and rescue team. The crew of the F-16 had planned to do a routine flyover ahead of this weekend's 2017 Vectren Dayton Air Show to familiarize themselves with the area, Heard said. The jet that crashed upon landing was not scheduled to perform at the show. The Thunderbirds were practicing their aerobatic maneuvers in thunderstorm conditions. Wind gusts this afternoon were about 11 to 17 miles per hour, Weather.com reported. According to Heard, the Thunderbirds will not to fly in Saturday's show. It wasn't immediately known if they will fly Sunday. The Dayton Air Show is no stranger to tragedy: In 2013, a pilot and stunt walker were killed when their bi-plane crashed onto the runway and burst into flames as spectators looked on.",english,24/06/2017 12:16,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/thunderbird-f-16-military-jet-flips-over-dayton-ohio-air-n776081,US,824,"Thunderbird F-16 Military Jet Flips Over at Dayton, Ohio, Air Show Practice",0,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/2050241/170623-thunderbird-dayton-air-show-crash-ew-205p_e1f6f8ebeaaee91484e2e5c3d14a26f7.nbcnews-ux-320-320.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,news
3,,Safia Samee Ali,24/06/2017,Ray Tensing Trial: Mistrial Declared for a Second Time,"An Ohio judge declared a mistrial for the second time in the case against Ray Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer charged with the 2015 shooting of an unarmed black driver during a traffic stop. After five days of deliberations, the jury said Friday afternoon it was deadlocked and Hamilton County Judge Leslie Ghiz declared a mistrial in the murder and voluntary manslaughter trial. The case spurred from a deadly encounter,caught on police cameras, between Tensing and 43-year-old motorist Samuel DuBose. This is the second time Tensing has been brought before a jury on criminal charges. The first round also ended in amistriallast year with a jury unable to come to a unanimous verdict after deliberating for more than 20 hours. DuBose's family said in a statement released shortly after the mistrial that they were ""outraged"" that a second jury failed to convict Tensing ""for the murder of our beloved Sam DuBose."" ""We demand another retrial. We call on the community to join us in peaceful protest of this unjust result,"" the family said. DuBose, a 43-year-old father of 13, was driving near the University of Cincinnati in July 2015 when he was pulled over by Tensing for missing a front license plate, police said. Tensing asked DuBose for his driver's license and registration, which he failed to provide. The officer then ordered him to step out of his car and tried to open the door, but DuBose refused. The car began to pull away. With one hand still inside the car, Tensing yelled, ""Stop! Stop!"" before firing his gun at DuBose, striking him in the head. The car then began traveling out of control before coming to a stop. Tensing's bodycam captured the incident. The men had a conversation for about one minute and 50 seconds before it escalated with Tensing and DuBose in a struggle. Within just a few seconds, Tensing fired his gun. Two other officers were on scene, and their body camerascaptured other angles of the shooting's aftermath. Prosecutors quickly announced murder and voluntary manslaughter charges against Tensing, and he became the first officer in Cincinnati to face murder charges for killing someone while on duty. Tensing told investigators that he feared for his life. Jurors in the second trial consisted of nine white jurors and three black jurors. During closing arguments, prosecutors said the case was a ""slam-dunk"" on manslaughter charges, according toNBC Cincinnati WLWT5. Meanwhile, defense attorneys said Tensing feared for his life and that questing on the officer’s actions is ""20/20 hindsight."" The case marks the third time in just one week that an officer who used deadly force against a civilian walked free.Minnesota officer Jeronimo Yanazwas acquitted on June 16 for fatally shooting Philando Castile, also during what was supposed to be a routine traffic stop.Milwaukee officer Dominique Heaggan-Brownwas also found not guilty Wednesday in the death of a 23-year-old Sylville K.

4,,Alexander Smith,24/06/2017,North Korea Defectors Find Unlikely Haven in London Suburb,"LONDON — The defectors who now call ""Little Pyongyang"" home paid a heavy price to get there. ""My big brother is currently in prison in North Korea and he's not getting released any time soon,"" Kim Kwang Myong told NBC News. ""The reason he is in prison is because of us fleeing the country."" ““It was a life-or-death decision””Around 5,300 miles from North Korea's brutal dictatorship, the bland commuter suburb of New Malden has become an improbable home to hundreds of escapees. With its sleepy town center and large, semi-detached houses, it is a world away from thehuman-rights abuses,poverty and isolationof their homeland. Kim's story is a common one. Like many people here, he fled North Korea but left family members behind. The regime often exercises a merciless policy of collective punishment against remaining relatives, sending them to labor camps, or worse. Kim, a 46-year-old carpenter, knew this. But he said inhumane conditions in the country gave him no choice. ""When I left North Korea it was a life-or-death decision,"" he said, speaking while colleagues around him noisily renovated a new Korean butchery in New Malden. Picking his moment, Kim bribed some border guards to vacate a stretch of North Korea's river border with China, allowing him to cross with his wife and two children. That was 20 years ago. He has since lived illegally in China and then in South Korea before coming to the U.K. four years ago. Kim has tried to help his relatives who stayed behind by sending them money. It was this that led to them being punished after authorities discovered the transactions. ""My younger brother was sent to prison and stayed there for one year but got released. But my big brother has not been so lucky,"" he said. His family has suffered, and that knowledge weighs heavily on Kim. ""We are talking about two different worlds, really,"" he said of the difference between his new and old homes. ""The reason why we fled from there is because life over there is really hard. It is simply impossible to live.""Nazi-style campsTotalitarian North Korea restricts every aspect of public life, throwing people intoNazi-style campsfor crimes as petty as ""gossiping"" about the state. Ordinary citizens are not allowed to access the internet or the international press, instead having to rely on the propaganda of North Korea's state-run media.",english,24/06/2017 12:22,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-defectors-find-unlikely-haven-london-s-new-malden-n766936,US,824,North Korea Defectors Find Unlikely Haven in London Suburb,0,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/2049421/170602-kim-kwang-myong-02-new-cr_3cf778ab295c4f0d7337d4765ff63918.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,news
5,,NA,22/06/2017,Donald Trump may face new legal action over Trump University,"Donald Trumpcould face new legal action over his controversial Trump University venture, after a new suit was filed in federal court. In November, days after he won the presidency, Trumpsettled three class action fraud lawsuits over Trump University, for $25m. More than 6,000 people were listed in the suits, claiming they were lured into paying up to $35,000 to learn the secrets of Trump’s business success. Now, one member of the class action lawsuits, Sherri Simpson, has filed an appeal against the settlement, claiming she was not allowed to exercise her right to “opt out” of the multimillion-dollar deal. If the ninth circuit court of appeals – one of two courts thatruled against Trump’s travel ban in June– decides in her favor, Simpson intends to sue the president independently for fraud, which she hopes could see him give evidence before a jury. “I believed in a jury trial,” Simpson told the Guardian. “It looked like we had such a strong case for trial after seven years of litigation.” Simpson, a bankruptcy attorney who took courses at Trump University in 2010, had planned to sue on her own before learning of, and joining, one of the three class action suits. In her appeal, her lawyers allege that she was told she would be able to be excluded from a settlement if she wished. Instead, Simpson says, she was not given forewarning of the $25m settlement with the president-elect – only learning of it from the media – and was not given a chance to withdraw.It was just all upsell. It was all a scam. It turned out it was a lot of cheerleading for Donald Trump and his successes.Sherri Simpson“We’re asking them to rule that there is no authority to approve a settlement in this case, because it did not allow the class members to opt out – to say yes or no to the settlement,” said Gary B Friedman, representing Simpson with fellow attorney Deepak Gupta. Trump University, a for-profit company that was not an accredited university or college, launched in 2005 with Trump promising that “students” would be mentored by hand-picked staff.A Trump University “playbook” released in May 2016 showedthat one of the pledges to enrollees read: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.” The fraud lawsuits alleged that students learnt nothing of the sort, despite being encouraged to pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend weekend seminars. Simpson, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said she received a leaflet through the mail in 2010 and eventually ended up spending $19,000 on tuition. “What I found from the very beginning was that it was just all upsell,” she said. “It was all a scam. It turned out it was a lot of cheerleading for Donald Trump and his successes.” Friedman said the ninth circuit had granted “expedited treatment” of Simpson’s appeal, with a verdict expected in late summer or early fall. If the court rules that Simpson should not have been included in the settlement, she will be free to pursue her own lawsuit against Trump. She has said she will not settle out of court.",englsih,24/06/2017 13:25,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/24/donald-trump-university-lawsuit-appeal-sherri-simpson,US,139,Donald Trump may face new legal action over Trump University,0,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96693c7a02d487d5e6168c55efc3510b1d6df425/0_0_3654_2193/master/3654.jpg?w=620&q=20&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&dpr=2&s=4cd6643d7361f424eec193499f6f98ae,0,0,0,0,0,politics
